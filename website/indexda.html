<td valign="top">Sources of, and methods and techniques for, acquiring authentic data stored in large repositories<p>&quot;Authentic&quot; data refers to facts that have not been corrupted since their creation.</p>
<p>Corruption tends to happen during processing and editing. e.g. an inappropriate choice of 'average' may be chosen. </p>
<p>e.g. A country ruled by a dictator has a population of a million people. 99% of them earn nearly no money. 1% are billionaires. The dictator proudly delares that his subjects earn an average (<em>mean</em>) of $100,000 a year. But the m<em>ode</em> - the most common value - is nearly zero.</p>
<p>Corruption may be <em>accidental</em>, e.g. valuable data is deleted or mistyped.</p>
<p>Corruption may be <em>deliberate</em>, e.g. &quot;cherry-picked&quot; to only present the data that supports the thesis of the publishers. e.g. &quot;The twentieth century was a peaceful time&quot; - leaving out any mention of world wars 1 and 2, Korea, Vietnam, Pol Pot, etc.</p>
<p>Authentic data must accurately represent the true state of the real world. And this is NOT easy.</p>
<p>Rarely, if ever, will data include 100% information from the entire population. Even the compulsory 2021 Australian census was only completed by 96% of the population.</p>
<p>Most data collections are <em>samples</em> of the full population, e.g. 10% of the total number of relevant people.</p>
<p>Samples may be unrepresentative of the population, e.g interviewing people walking down the street at 10am on a weekday about health care could artificially select a large number of unemployed or retired people, who could well provide a skewed and unrepresentative result.</p>
<p>Authentic data is more likely to come from a competent, unbiased source that has the resouces to gather and process the data fairly.</p>
<p>Biased sources (those with a vested interest in the contents of the data) are to be treated with suspicion: e.g. churches, policical zealots, idiots, agitators... </p>
<p>Basically, that includes <em>everyone</em>. Collecting masses of data is very difficult and expensive, and is usually  undertaken by organisations who will somehow benefit from presenting the data. Ask yourself: &quot;Here is a lot of data. Who collected it? Why did they collect it? What did they gain?&quot;</p>
<p>But let us ignore the motive and competence of data sources for the moment. Let's assume the data is representative, vast, and honest.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="https://reg.bom.gov.au/climate/data-services/">Australian Bureau of Meteorology's (BOM) historical weather statistics</a>. But data is not always free: even the government's BOM charges for large data requests.</p>
<p>Large data requests usually involve an <strong>API</strong> - application programming interface. It's a way that a data provider can supply data to users safely. It's like buying something behind the counter at a milk bar. You approach the API interface (the counter), make your request to the shop assistant (the API) in a fashion they can understand, and are provided with the goods you need. The API  controls what data (goods) are provided, and the provider protect itself with defences such as a counter, bulletproof glass windows, and logins.</p>
<p>Many large data sources, such as Quora, Reddit, Wikipedia, IMDb, offer an API to allow high-volume users to request and receive their data.</p>
<p>The <strong>format</strong> of the data provided by a large data repository is important to consider. Can you decode it?</p>
<p>You might be able to load a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet if you have Excel or a clone (e.g. <em>Libre Office</em> - my favourite).</p>
<p>But what if the download is in an unfamiliar or unhelpful format like XML, JSON, RSS, or CSV? You might be able to download it, but can you interpret it?</p>
<p>Probably not, if you're a casual user with a spreadsheet on your PC.</p>
<p><em>Large</em> data repositories with APIs are <em>not</em> intended for casual download cowboys. They are for Big Data Grownups who know what JSON is, and can convert from XML to SQL. T'hats probably not you. It's certainly not me.</p>
<p>And once you have acquired a LARGE data set - what is 'large'? We may be talking not just megabtytes, but <strong>gigabytes</strong> of data. Petabytes, maybe.</p>
<p>Your  phone can't handle that. Your laptop probably can't. </p>
<p>Your 2023 desktop with an Intel Core i7-13700K running at 3.4GHZ with 32 GB of RAM and a 12TB HDD would be struggling to process such quantities of data.</p>
<p>Your <em>MS Excel</em> or <em>Libre Office Calc</em> would freeze in shock.</p>
<p><em>Large</em> data repositories are seriously large. </p>
<p>There are <em>data warehouses</em>, gathering data from many sources. There are <em>data lakes</em>. Data marts, with data that is specific to certain users. Data cubes. The list goes on.</p>
<p>SO</p>
<p>To summarise...</p>
<p><strong>Authentic data</strong> is trustworthy and unpolluted by errors or misinformation.</p>
<p>It is available from reliable sources that have no reason to mislead their users.</p>
<p>It is usually provided though an API that controls the requests for and delivery of stored data.</p>
<p>It is often available in huge quantities in formats that many casual users will not be able to easily process.</p>

<h3>Querying of data repositories</h3>
<p>Refers to searching datasets to extract useful information from the masses of data.<br>
  May query primary data (original data collected personally by the researchers) or secondary data (data collected by other people, e.g. government departments like CSIRO)<br>
  Many providers of secondary data provide an API (application programming interface) to allow outsiders controlled access to their datasets.<br>
  E.g. the Australian Bureau of Meteorology lets developers create apps that extract weather forecast data from its databases.</p>
<p>Queries may use SQL or QBE</p>
<p><strong>SQL</strong> = Structured Query Language. A standardised format for selecting data from databases. E.g.</p>
<p><span class="blue">SELECT</span> * <span class="blue">FROM</span> Book <span class="blue">WHERE</span> price &gt; 100.00 <span class="blue">ORDER BY</span> title;</p>
<p><strong>QBE</strong> = Query By Example. The user types what they want to find in the field they want to find it.</p>

<td valign="top">Suitability of quantitative and qualitative data for manipulation<p><img src="/ppt.png" width="28" height="22" alt="vcedata.com slideshow"/> </p>
<p><strong>Quantitative data</strong> - usually <strong>numeric</strong>. It is fact-based, measures of values or counts - e.g. this printer produces <strong>15</strong> pages per minute</p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<p><img src="/m/quantitative-data-eg.jpg" width="917" height="121" alt=""></p>
<p><em>From the ABS website, 2022-02-28</em></p>
<p>Quantitative data can be verified for accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Qualitative data</strong> - descriptive, judgemental, non-stastical, unstructured, opinion-based data expressed in <strong>words</strong> rather than number - e.g. &quot;I think this page layout is attractive.&quot; It can be&nbsp;in the form of text, video, photos, audio recordings, art, music, body&nbsp;language, facial expressions... anything that can't be measured and given a numeric value.</p>
<p>Arbitrary categories are also qualitative, e.g. fashionable vs unfashionable&nbsp;clothes, social class, conservative vs liberal politician.</p>
<p>Whenever possible and appropriate, prefer <em>quantitative</em> data. It's hard to argue with.</p>
<p>Use <em>qualitative</em> data if you have to, especially regarding human&nbsp;feelings that cannot be measured. e.g. &quot;<em>That</em> logo is cute. The other one is yucky - urghh&quot;</p>
<p>Example: </p>
<p>SEX = quantitative - must be male, female, intersex - according to Australian law. It can be scientifically established.</p>
<p>vs</p>
<p>GENDER = qualitative -&nbsp; it depends on an individual's emotions or judgement, and cannot be externally proved or disproved.</p>
<p>The Australian Bureau of Statistics website defines qualitative data as &quot;measures of 'types' and may be represented by a name, symbol, or a number code. Qualitative data are data about categorical variables (e.g. what type).&quot;</p>
<p>(But what would they know?)</p>
<p>Note - neither quantitative nor qualitative data is always better or worse than the other. Their value depends on appropriateness to a particular use. They are often used <em>together</em> to fully describe a situation.</p>
<p>e.g. when researching students, it is found that 32% show elevated stress levels&nbsp;using data about their blood pressure, blood cortisol levels etc. That is valuable quantitative data, but it does not explain the <em>reasons</em> for the stress. That qualitative data - which can vary from person to person - can only be gathered through other means such as observation, interviews, surveys etc.</p>
<p>e.g. When buying a printer, quantitative speed measurements are valuable. When judging the layout of a book cover, qualitative data about people's reactions and emotions is more important.</p>

The forms that an item of data can take, including binary (as represented in images and sound), Boolean, character and numeric, characterised by the kind of operations that can be performed on it. Depending on the software being used, these data types can be divided into more specific data types, for example integer and floating point, which are numeric types. More sophisticated types can be derived from them, for example a string of characters or a data type, and their names may vary, such as text data type versus string data type.

 <!DOCTYPE html></p>
 <h2 > Consistency (not examinable, but important)</h2>
 <p >For data to have integrity, it should be consistent. Inconsistency occurs <em>within</em> a single data source or <em>between</em> data sources when conflicting versions of data appear in different places. Data inconsistency is unwelcome because it means that data have become unreliable. If the &lsquo;true&rsquo; value cannot be determined, the entire data source loses integrity and becomes tainted. Any information drawn from it becomes untrustworthy.</p>
 <p >Examples:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>a 	date of birth in one database table does not match an age calculated 	in another table</li>
 <li>in 	one survey question people say they&rsquo;ve never used drugs, but later 	answers say they used marijuana more than zero times</li>
 <li>data 	stored in one location (e.g. a local database) does not match 	corresponding data in another location (e.g. a linked website 	database).</li>
 </ul>
 <p >Common cures:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>normalise 	to third normal form (3NF) to ensure proper synchronisation of table 	data, and prevent duplicate data. Any data stored in more than one 	place immediately invites the risk of inconsistency. If employee 	addresses are stored in the STAFF database and also the CONTACTS 	database, they could easily become inconsistent if one table is 	updated and the other is not. </li>
 <li>enforce 	referential integrity in databases to ensure key fields cannot be 	deleted without also deleting or modifying related fields. If the 	&lsquo;Sales&rsquo; department is deleted from the &lsquo;Departments&rsquo; table, 	everyone working in &lsquo;Sales&rsquo; need to be either deleted or moved 	to another department, otherwise their &lsquo;Department&rsquo; data becomes 	meaningless.</li>
 <li>ask 	the same question again in different ways to check the consistency 	of answers in surveys and questionnaires. This is important for 	issues about which people tend to lie or bend the truth to avoid 	embarrassment or boost their egos. Question 7 may ask &ldquo;Do you 	gamble?&rdquo; and question 37 may ask &ldquo;Last year, how often did you 	bet on a horse, buy a lottery ticket, or use poker machines?&rdquo; 	People often forget they fibbed in an earlier question and 	accidentally tell the truth later!</li>
 <li>Use 	electronic checking to detect inconsistent answers. e.g. <span >IF 	(NumberOfChildren = 0 and AgeOfOldestChild &gt; 0) then Consistency 	Error!</span></li>
 <li>Use 	a single master-copy data source (&lsquo;Single Point of Truth&rsquo; or 	&lsquo;SPOT&rsquo;) instead of multiple data clones that are sluggishly 	synchronised. If all data was read from a single master copy rather 	than a copy that is only updated occasionally, the data is 	guaranteed to be up to date.</li>
 <li>use 	consistent data formatting and validation rules to enforce 	consistent data entry. If people can enter a birthdate in either of 	two places in a database, use the same data format in each location. 	Don&rsquo;t expect &ldquo;YYYY-MM-DD&rdquo; on one form and &ldquo;D MMM YY&rdquo; on 	the other form.</li>
 <li>use 	an input mask to force a particular data entry format. (e.g. 	XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX for credit card numbers)</li>
 <li>use 	fuzzy logic to handle trivial differences in data e.g. accept 	&lsquo;Robert&rsquo; if he&rsquo;s also known as &lsquo;Bob&rsquo;; treat &ldquo;St Kilda&rdquo; 	the same as &ldquo;Saint Kilda.&rdquo;</li>
 <li>standardise 	data so they are in a consistent, predictable and comparable format
  <ul>
  <li>store 		family names in all capitals so - when doing comparisons and 		queries - &ldquo;Smith&rdquo; is not overlooked as a match for &ldquo;smith&rdquo; 		or &ldquo;SMITH&rdquo;</li>
  <li>strip 		spaces from phone number data, and the beginnings and ends of all 		text data.</li>
  <li>when 		dates are stored as text, they always use the same format</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 </ul>
 <p ><img src="/think.png" width="30" height="31" alt="Thinking Time"/>&ldquo;YYYY-MM-DD&rdquo; is the international ISO standard format for dates. e.g. <a href="/Library/currentyear.lbi">currentyear</a>-01-02 means 2 January <a href="/Library/currentyear.lbi">currentyear</a>. Can you suggest why is there an international standard for date formats? </p>
 <ul>
 <ul>
  <li>use 		a standardised time setting, such as Greenwich Mean Time, 		Australian Eastern Summer Time etc. </li>
  <li>use 		a consistent year numbering scheme: 
  <ul>
   <li>Common 			Era (e.g. &lsquo;the moon landing in 1969&rsquo;)</li>
   <li>Islamic 			(&lsquo;the moon landing in 1347&rsquo;)</li>
   <li>Jewish 			(&lsquo;the moon landing in 5729&rsquo;)</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>all 		currency values are stored in the same units (e.g. $AU, $US, &pound;UK, 		&euro;)</li>

  <p>Welp! This KK is a three-year course in itself. It includes nearly everything you consider &quot;IT&quot;</p>
  <p>So, let's try to break this down into manageable chunks:</p>
  <p>Manipulating data  = basically what <strong>any</strong> software does. If software doesn't manipulate data, <em>it's not software</em>.</p>
  <p class="myanswer">Data manipulation = using data to create new data (e.g. create a graph from a table of numbers)</p>
  <p class="myanswer">Data modification = changing data to a new value and replacing the original data (e.g. replacing Excel cell E3 with a new value)</p>
  <h2>How can data be manipulated?  </h2>
  <p><strong>Sorted</strong>, e.g.  by size, name, age, </p>
  <p><strong>Categorised</strong> - e.g. by media type, musical genre</p>
  <p><strong>Summarised</strong> - statistically: to find averages, trends, maximum &amp; minimum values</p>
  <p><strong>Converted</strong> - to different forms, e.g. from numeric data to a visual graph, from digital data to sound or video. Converting a spreadsheet into a database. Converting a slideshop into a webpage. Reformatting data.</p>
  <p><strong>Compressed</strong> - e.g. with JPG / GIF / TIFF (images), MP3 /  FLAC (audio), RAR / ZIP (files) , </p>
  <p><strong>Encrypted</strong> -  PGP, WEP / WPA (wifi), HTTPS, SSL / TLS (web pages)</p>
  <p><strong>Deleted,  merged, inserted</strong></p>
  <hr>
  <h2>Common data manipulation software tools</h2>
  <p><strong>Spreadsheet</strong> - a flat-file database (though VLOOKUP gives some valuable relational ability)</p>
  <p><strong>Relational database</strong> - with two or more related tables</p>
  <p><strong>Specialist tools</strong> - e.g. video editors, web browsers, file managers, text editors. They are very limited in the data they can accept and the manipulation they can do, but they are vital for specific tasks.</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>SPREADSHEETS</h2>
  <p>If you only spent an hour in a spreadsheet class, you would have been told about:</p>
  <p>- the structure of spreadsheets: sheets, rows, columns, cells, formulas, values</p>
  <p>- basic functions - sum, average, maximum/minimum</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <hr>
  <h2>DATABASES</h2>
  <p>If you only spent three hours in a database class, you would have been told about:</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>- the structure of databases: tables, records, fields</p>
  <p>- relationships between tables</p>
  <p>- queries, reports</p>
  <p>- basic functions - sum, average,  maximum/minimum</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>More to come, eventually</p>

  of data and information security strategies.</strong>
</h3>
  <p><strong>Point 1</strong> - <em>Effectiveness</em> relates to how well the job is done, regardless of time, money or effort is expended. <strong>Efficiency</strong> refers to speed, cost and labour. Everything else is <em>effectiveness</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Point 2</strong> - <em>Criteria</em> are the relevant factors used to measure the value of something. e.g. the criteria of a cat are: <em>fluffiness</em>, <em>purriness</em>, <em>jumpiness</em>. Not how well they <em>guard the house</em>, or <em>lead the blind</em>..</p>
<p><strong>Point 3</strong> - Data: the raw, unprocessed numbers gained from a sensor, survey, census, or other data-gathering system. <strong>Data</strong> have <em>potential</em> data, but are unorganised, bulky, and their meaning is unclear,</p>
<p><strong>Point 4</strong> - Information: is processed from data to create meaningful and understandable knowledge. e.g. A national census may contain the incomes of 15 million people (which is <em>data</em>) but only when those 15 million incomes are added up or averaged will useful <em>information</em> be derived from them.</p>
<p>e.g.:</p>
<ul>
  <li>DATA = <strong>crude oil</strong>. Unprocessed, may be useful.</li>
  <li>INFORMATION = <strong>petrol</strong>. Processed. Useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>So - back to the Key Knowledge.</p>
<p>How does one evaluate how well different methods protect the security of data and information?</p>
<p>We're not worried about what the different methods <em>are</em>. They might involve armed guards, virus scanners, ceiling-mounted laser cannons. It matters not.</p>
<p>What we're worried about is what rules we use to judge the quality of the different methods.</p>
<p>Now it gets easier.</p>
<p>What criteria would you use to judge to evaluate the effectiveness of a <strong>CAR</strong>? speed, reliability, running costs, safety, seating capacity, cup holders.</p>
<p>What criteria would you use to judge to evaluate the effectiveness of a<strong> DOG</strong>?  woofiness, friendliness, size. OK. I don't understand dogs.</p>
<p>In case you're getting bored, here's a picture of a dog.</p>
<p><img src="/m/hungrydog.gif" width="249" height="311" alt=""/></p>
<p>You use very different criteria when judging cats and dogs.</p>
<p>And you use different vriteria for evaluating the effectiveness<img src="/bits/gloss.png" width="8" height="12" alt=""

<p><strong>CRITERIA:</strong></p>
<p>- <span class="crossedout">Speed of response to the threat</span>. <strong>Nope!</strong> That is an <em><strong>efficiency </strong>criterion</em>, not <em>effectiveness</em> as the KK asks. Same applies to the <em>cost</em>, or <em>amount of labour</em> required. Be careful!</p>
<p>- <strong>Accuracy</strong>. How many <strong>false negatives</strong> (real attacks that were <em>not</em> detected) or <strong>false alarms</strong> (harmless events that were wrongly judged as being harmful) were recorded?</p>
<p>- <strong>Usefulness</strong>. If a strategy gave useful information about the <em>source</em> of the threat, the <em>type or nature</em> of the threat, how to <em>counteract</em> the threat etc, it would be a jolly good strategy. It would give quality information.</p>
<p>- <strong>Recoverability</strong> - yes, it's an ugly word (and not examinable) but a quality data security strategy would offer a quick and easy way to get back lost or damaged data quickly and accurately. You could also call it <em>resilence</em> - the ability to get back to normal after a setback.</p>
<p>- <strong>Reliability</strong>- can the strategy be trusted? Is it dodgy? </p>
<p>- <strong>Comprehensiveness</strong>- Does the strategy detect all relevant threats? A security scanner that completely ignores <em>trojan horses</em> or <em>rootkits</em>, for example, may leave a system open to exploitation..</p>
<p>- Basically - ANY means of judgement that does NOT involve speed, cost, or labour.</p>
