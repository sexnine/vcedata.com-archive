  <td ><p>Examiners' report comments were added 5 June 2013. See the <a href="http://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/Documents/exams/technology/2012/softwaredev_assessrep12.pdf">original 2012 SD exam report</a> on the VCAA site.</p>
    <p class="examiner">The multiple-choice questions were well done by many students. Areas of weakness tended to be the theoretical 
      components of the study, such as control structures, design characteristics and the purpose of a software requirements 
      specification (SRS). Throughout the year, it may be useful for students to practise answering questions based on these 
      areas.      </p>
    <p class="examiner">In general, Section B required students to demonstrate sound theoretical knowledge and to provide detailed and accurate      responses. In 2012, this section contained two questions that asked students to apply their knowledge of pseudocode 
      algorithms. The study design specifies pseudocode as the only algorithmic representation to be used as a method of 
      expressing software designs. Many students appeared to welcome the challenge to demonstrate their skills in this area.      </p>
    <p class="examiner">The format of Section C was consistent with that of previous years and student responses were expected to refer to the 
      case study. The key weakness of many responses in this section was the lack of depth and detail provided by students. 
      During the examination, students should      </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="examiner">endeavour to use correct IT terminology      </li>
      <li class="examiner">discuss all options when asked to justify a choice or compare one option to another     </li>

Bill is writing a new software application for a small real estate company. Four real estate agents from the company all want an application on their mobile phones that allows them to access the data files back at the office while they are out. Each agent has a different model/make of phone.<br />
To obtain information to help Bill write the software requirements specification (SRS), the most appropriate action for him to take is to<br />A. &nbsp;interview all four real estate agents.<br />
B. &nbsp;observe one real estate agent at work.<br />
C. &nbsp;survey at least four clients to find out what they would like.<br />
D. &nbsp;interview at least four clients to find out what they would like.
</p>
<p class="myanswer">Answer is A. Interviewing the clients would not tell him what the agents need from the software, so rule out C and D. While watching one real estate agent might give detailed information on how they work, interviewing all 4 would give more information about their needs.</p>

A code of ethics for software developers is a set of moral principles and guidelines that assists when<br />A. &nbsp;a logic error is found within a program code.<br />
B. &nbsp;a runtime error is found within a program code.<br />
C. &nbsp;an issue occurs with management over pay and conditions.<br />
D. &nbsp;an issue occurs with management over what a program will do.
</p>
<p class="myanswer">I think the answer should be C. A code of ethics describes how people should behave morally, which makes A and B irrelevant. D is not an ethical issue, leaving C, which is a human matter.</p>
<p class="myanswer"><em>I interpreted option D as a simple argument about scope: should the program be expected to produce emails, for example - a trivial matter that would not use a code of ethics to sort out.</em></p>
<p class="myanswer"><em><img src="/m/schmackomaybe.jpg" alt="bad?" width="98" height="150" hspace="3" align="right" />I interpreted my preferred option C as a position where management might be (legally) exploiting work contracts to force programmers into working unfair hours or reducing their pay. That's where I thought a code of ethics could be used to prevent such exploitation.</em></p>
<p class="myanswer"><em>However, others have argued that &lt;D&gt; could mean that programmers are instructed to put ethically-unacceptable functionality into a program (e.g. a keylogger). That's valid.</em></p>
<p class="myanswer"><em>So there is a problem in the vagueness of &quot;an issue&quot;. Since others and I can come up with different issues that satisfy options C and D, they both should be accepted by markers.</em></p>

C. &nbsp;harder to set up, more secure and cheaper.<br />
D. &nbsp;harder to set up, more secure but will not work over long distances.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Answer is B. Cabling can be expensive. The supposed extra security of wireless rules out C and D, which leaves you to focus on A and B, and since we know wireless is less secure than cable, A also goes.</p>

A procedure is required that can sort a list of randomly arranged items. This list can be of any given size. Two separate procedures are written, one using a quick sort algorithm and the other using a bubble sort algorithm. The performance of each procedure is compared by measuring the time it takes to sort an increasing number of list items. The results are shown below.</p>
<div align="left"></div>
<p align="left"><img src="/m/pm/12s-a13.jpg" width="421" height="280" alt="A13" /><br />
The graph line that most likely represents the performance of the bubble sort is<br />A. &nbsp;neither (1) nor (5) because a bubble sort cannot sort very large lists.<br />
B. &nbsp;(2) because a bubble sort generally takes less time than a quick sort.<br />
C. &nbsp;(1) because a bubble sort generally takes more time than a quick sort.<br />
D. &nbsp;neither (1) nor (2) because the time taken for a bubble sort does not depend on the list size.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Answer is C. Bubble sorts are quite easy to code, but become exponentially less efficient as the amount of data to sort increases. Quick sort is harder to code, but is quicker with large data sets.</p>

<td><p><strong>Question 15</strong><br />
Xian wants to design games for handheld personal computers and mobile phones. What are the most important characteristics of mobile phones that Xian should consider?<br />A. &nbsp;screen size, weight and memory size<br />
B. &nbsp;screen size, weight and operating system<br />
C. &nbsp;screen resolution, processor speed and memory size<br />
D. &nbsp;screen resolution, memory size and operating system</p>
<p class="myanswer">Answer is D. This is a bit of a tricky one. We can safely eliminate weight as a factor for a programmer to worry about; after all, what could a programmer do to address a weight issue (apart from eating less pizza, but I digress.) That leaves only C and D.</p>
<p class="myanswer">The only difference between the remaining options is processor speed vs operating system, and the programmer can't do much about the processor speed, apart from try to code more cunningly if the CPU is slow. </p>
<p class="myanswer">The operating system, however, is definitely going to affect the way a programmer works when coding because the OS may or may not, for example, support certain input devices (e.g. handwriting recognition) which would mean the programmer must seek alternative solutions.</p>
<p class="examiner">Alternatives A and B were not viable options because the  weight of a mobile phone would not affect the  programmer's coding. Memory size and screen resolution  are both important considerations when designing games  (images and clarity), but it is the operating system (option  D) rather than the processor speed (option C) that will most affect the functioning of a games program on a mobile  phone. Incompatible operating systems would render a  program inoperable, whereas processor speed is likely to  allow the program to run but at a lower speed.</p>

The name, date of birth, membership number, address, suburb, postcode and phone number of one person is to be stored in memory. Which one of the following would be the best data structure?<br />A. &nbsp;record<br />
B. &nbsp;random file<br />
C. &nbsp;sequential file<br />
D. &nbsp;one-dimensional array</p>
<p class="myanswer">Answer is A. A record is a structure that is defined by the programmer to contain a complete set of data fields of different data types. B and C only exist on disk, not in memory as the question insists. A 1D array can store a lot of data, but each entry has to be the same data type.</p>
<p class="comment">Maggie has pointed out that PHP users could opt for record or array, since PHP can store different data types in a 1D array. I hope the markers are aware of that aspect of PHP! It's a pity that PHP students can't explain their answers in section A.</p>

Joanne, the owner of a small business that sells computer equipment, has asked a software developer to write a simple software solution that will allow her customers to buy items online. As her business is only small, she does not want to go to the expense of implementing secure storage or password protection.<br />
The software developer advises strongly that secure storage and password protection must be included, but it will cost more. This advice creates a conflict.<br />
Who are the major stakeholders affected by this conflict?<br />A. &nbsp;Joanne, her customers and the software developer<br />
B. &nbsp;Joanne, her customers and her equipment suppliers<br />
C. &nbsp;Joanne, her internet service provider and her equipment suppliers<br />
D. &nbsp;Joanne's customers, her internet service provider and the software developer</p>
<p class="myanswer">Answer is A. The ISP and equipment suppliers are irrelevant. Joanne is a stakeholder because she must pay for the extra programming. Her customers are stakeholders because their financial data is potentially at risk of being revealed. The software developer is a stakeholder because he/she is making money from the work, and could potentially get into professional trouble by deliberately releasing substandard software.</p>

  To be both a worm and spyware, a malware program must have the ability to access and record personal information, but also  hold the ability to self-replicate in order to spread.</p>

<p align="left" class="comment">That's all you need to write.</p>
<p align="left" class="examiner">The majority of students were able to identify that the development stage was the appropriate stage of the<br />
  problem-solving methodology at which to undertake program coding.</p>
<p align="left" class="examiner">Average mark 90%</p>
<p align="left"> Minama is unsure about what naming convention he should follow.<br />
b.<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/indent.lbi" -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp; i.&nbsp;&nbsp; Identify two features of a naming convention for solution elements of a program that Minama could use. 2 marks</p>
<ul>
<li class="myanswer">One that prefixes an object with an indicator of the object's type, e.g. intIncome or cmdCalculate (i.e. Hungarian notation)</li>
<li class="myanswer">One that uses multiple words in a name, with the beginning of each word marked by the use of a capital letter (i.e. CamelCase)</li>
</ul>
<p class="examiner">Students were asked to identify two features of a naming convention. Many confused this with stating a naming<br />
  convention, such as Hungarian notation or camel case. There was a range of acceptable features that students could  have identified, including capitalisation, underscores and abbreviated start of the variable for object type.<br />
  The following is an example of a high-scoring response.<br />
  The first three letters of an element name should denote what type of element it is. For example for a button the name would  begin with 'btn'. The remainder of the name should describe the elements function, with each word beginning with a capital.  For example, 'btnPrintReceipt'.</p>
<p align="left">ii.&nbsp;&nbsp; Explain how this naming convention helps both the development and the maintenance of the software solution. 2 marks</p>
<p align="left" class="myanswer">Indicating the type of an object makes it less likely that a programmer will accidentally and inappropriately treat it as if it were a different type of object (e.g. confusing an integer and a floating point number, leading to the loss of decimal places.) This is likely to happen when programmers are maintaining other people's code.</p>
<p align="left" class="myanswer">CamelCase encourages the use of meaningful names, yet makes them easier to read and less potentially ambiguous, e.g. the famous penisland.com would be better as PenIsland.com, choosepain.com is more understandable as ChooseSpain.com, and itscrap.com is actually an IT scrap recycler.</p>
<p align="left" class="examiner">  Students needed to explain how a naming convention could help both development and maintenance of a solution to  gain full marks. They could have mentioned the following features: consistency, simplicity, sets standards for all 
  variables, easy to read, easier to understand code, etc. Students are advised to avoid using the words 'efficiency' and  'effectiveness' without any qualifying statements (for example, 'it makes it more efficient'), as responses such as this  often result in low or no marks.<br />
  The following is an example of a high-scoring response: 
  During development, the meaningful variable names easily identify what the variable is and makes it easier to understand the  code of the program. During maintenance, meaningful variable names with capitalised letters make the program much more  clear and readable and makes the process of finding errors and modifying code easier.</p>

<p align="left" class="examiner">Appropriate responses included 'when creating a prototype' or 'when creating a program that is used infrequently'.<br />
  A number of students thought the correct response was to say this should never happen. However, the question<br />
  specifically asked when this could occur.<br />
  The following are examples of a high-scoring response: 
  'This may be the case when the needed program is simple and won't have any long term application. If the program is simple in  design then its developers should not have to spend large amount of time creating the solution which reduces the cost of the  programmers wages. As long as the program doesn't have a long useful life and the scope of the program isn't very large. This may be the case if it is only going to be used once, and does not require future maintenance or alterations and if only the  sole programmer is making it, so no others need to read the code.  This may be the case when making an example program to show functionality, that is not part of the solution code. As the code  will be written quickly and discarded afterwards, it does not need to be written well as it will not be used in the real solution,  only as an example or demonstration.'</p>

<span class="comment">
There are no rules about pseudocode syntax, so there are many variations you could choose for the loop structure's syntax (e.g. WHILE..WEND), and you could have chosen the alternative loop type (e.g. DO..WHILE) that tests at the end rather than at the top. </span>
<p align="left" class="comment">Actually. the wording of the algorithm implies that the doubling of A and incrementing of B occurs at least once, and <strong>then</strong> the test happens, so a <strong>bottom-driven</strong> loop (e.g. DO..WHILE) now seems more appropriate than a WHILE..WEND type of <strong>top-driven</strong> loop. Is this significant in the marking, I wonder? </p>
<p align="left" class="comment">The choice of top vs bottom driven loop can be vital - it all depends on whether the enclosed code should be allowed to run even <strong>once</strong>. For example... </p>

<p align="left">CASE STUDY INSERT FOR SECTION C<br />
Please remove from the centre of this book during reading time. </p>
<h3 align="center">The air quality and asthma study</h3>
<p align="left">  The government has funded Bigton University to carry out a major study into the effects of air pollution on asthma sufferers in Victoria. They would like to find out</p>
<ol>
<li>how much effect common air pollutants have on asthmatics</li>
<li>the geographical distribution of asthma attacks in relation to the time when they occur and the pollutants involved. </li>
</ol>
<p align="left">Dr John Fischer has been put in charge of the research. He has a team of postgraduate students who will acquire data about air pollution and asthma, and store it in one place so that they can analyse it.</p>
<p align="left">  To achieve the goals of the study, the team will recruit up to 1500 volunteer asthmatics from as many parts of Victoria as possible and collect data from them during a one-year period.</p>
<p align="left">  The data collection system must obtain data about symptoms from the asthmatics as well as obtain measurements of air quality, location and time for up to 24 hours before an asthma episode. The data must also be acquired by a method that is portable.</p>
<p align="left">  One of the team members suggests that they could give each asthmatic a 'smart' mobile phone. The asthmatic could enter data about their asthma episode and the phone could provide the location and time data.</p>
<p align="left">  Dr Fischer asks the university's engineering department to design a cheap device that can measure levels of four common air pollutants, so that the data collection system can measure air quality. He would also like this device to be attached to a mobile phone.</p>
<h4 align="left">The Clip-on Air Sampler and Sensor Array</h4>
<p align="left"> In response to Dr Fischer's request, the engineering department has designed and built a small device that can be clipped onto the back of a mobile phone.</p>
<p align="left">  The Clip-on Air Sampler and Sensor Array (CASSA) contains four sensors, one for each air pollutant of interest. In order for the CASSA to work properly, users must wear the phone and the device on a belt rather than having it in their pocket or handbag. The CASSA is a simple device that communicates with the mobile phone via a mini USB cable. It is capable of taking one set of measurements every five minutes.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="/m/pm/12s-casestudy3.jpg" width="669" height="242" alt="case study pic 3" /></p>
<h4>The Air Quality and Asthma Data Acquisition System (AQADAS)</h4>
<p><br />
Now that the team has the hardware to capture all the data that it needs for the study, it can start work on creating a system that will collect and store all this data. One of the team members, Ilma, is studying computer programming. She agrees to design the Air Quality and Asthma Data Acquisition System (AQADAS) and write whatever software is needed. Two other students, Anton and Maria, offer to help her.</p>
<p>  Ilma starts her analysis by leading a discussion about how data collection in AQADAS could work. The three students think that the simplest approach would be</p>
<ol>
<li>either during the asthma episode or soon after an episode, the asthmatic enters details about their symptoms into the mobile phone</li>
<li>after completing the entry, the asthmatic sends all the data acquired by the mobile phone to a central file server at the university, as shown in Diagram 2.</li>
</ol>
<p>As the discussion proceeds, Ilma draws a data flow diagram (DFD). The three students agree that the DFD shown in Diagram 3 represents what they need for the data collection section of the system. They also agree to work out the details of the main data store later. Ilma draws a single data store to represent all the data that would be stored in the system. Similarly she draws a single process to show the research team's own data processing requirements.</p>

<p align="left" class="examiner">This question asked students to analyse the case study and identify solution requirements &ndash; both functional (what it is  required) and non-functional (the solution attributes, such as user-friendliness, response rates, robustness, portability,  reliability and maintainability). Many students were unable to write solution requirements, and confused functional and  non-functional requirements.<br />
  Throughout the year, clear and concise solution requirements should be modelled (using dot points, numbered lists,  tables, etc.), where appropriate, in design briefs and SRS. In addition, students should practise identifying and writing  appropriate solution requirements from provided stimulus material.</p>

<p align="left" class="comment">This was trickier than I thought. I first just attached the symptom_data arrow to the CASSA external entity and thought, &quot;3 marks... but I've only added 2 things, the data flow and the label. How are they going to mark this? I must be missing something.&quot; Another read of the case study made it clearer. I was treating the CASSA unit and the mobile phone as a single entity, but the phone should be considered a separate entity responsible for the symptom data. The new entity, the data flow arrow and the label accounted for 3 marks. The moral of the story: when you have an indeterminate number of things to add, use the marking scheme to guide you to how many items are expected.</p>
<p align="left" class="comment">19 Nov 2012 - Our friend Kevork has pointed out an interesting issue with this context diagram. It shows CASSA providing sensor data directly to AQADAS, but the DFD clearly shows CASSA's data going to the phone for collation and transmission. We all know data flows between external entities do not appear in CDs or DFDs, so strictly speaking the CD is wrong. </p>
<p align="left" class="comment">VCAA might say that CASSA provides data to AQADAS and the phone is just an intermediary, but the phone does have to collate the data... &nbsp;Hmmm. Interesting. What do you guys think?</p>
<p align="left" class="examiner">Many students were not able to complete the context diagram provided. Students should have carefully read the case  study stimulus material that was provided in the insert since it contained a data flow diagram (DFD) that would have  assisted them with completing the diagram. A significant number of students identified the 'mobile phone' as an  external entity, when in fact it should have been 'asthmatics'; they provide the data. The mobile phone is the collection  device and thus not included on a DFD.</p>

They also needed to ensure that  reasons were provided, applicable to the case study, to justify their contention.  An example of an acceptable answer for supporting a VPN is the increased security will better protect the privacy of  asthmatics.

As shown in the DFD, the air quality data will be stored in the data store  <strong>accumulated_air_quality_data</strong>. Since only 24 hours of data is needed, after each measurement is taken any air quality measurement that is more than 24 hours old will be deleted.<br />
What type of data structure is most suited to storing data in this way? Justify your selection, making reference to other data structures. 3 marks</p>
<p align="left">data structure</p>
<p align="left" class="myanswer">a sequential data file </p>
<p align="left" class="black">justification </p>
<p align="left" class="myanswer">In 24 hours, there would only be 288 records to store (24 * 12 per hour), which is quite a modest quantity of data. A sequential text file would be very easy to code and it would not require the superior retrieval speed offered by a&nbsp;<strong>random file </strong>which comes at the cost of fixed-length records (which can be wasteful of space) and increased coding complexity.</p>
<p align="left" class="myanswer">Alternatively does the data store need to be in a file at all? This relatively small amount of data could be stored in RAM in records containing 4 numeric pollutant readings + location code + time + date fields.</p>
<p align="left" class="comment"><em>The study design's key knowledge refers to data structures as being (with my <strong>emphasis</strong>)<br />
- 
U3O2 KK03 - types of data structures, including one-dimensional arrays, <strong>records</strong> and <strong>files</strong><br />
-
U4O1 KK10 - forms and uses of data structures to organise and manipulate data, including two-dimensional arrays, stacks and <strong>queues</strong></em></p>
<p align="left" class="comment">Others have said that it should be a queue. I'm not so sure. A queue keeps incoming data in order so it can be processed in order, but the DFD shows the pollutant data is stored with its timestamp, so the data need not be stored in any particular order: they could be sorted and processed using their timestamp.</p>
<p align="left" class="comment">So files, records and queues are on the agenda. Which is right? The markers should be able to accept any of them with a reasonable and relevant justification, IMO.</p>
<p align="left" class="examiner">Even though there is considerable information provided in the case study insert, students need to ensure that they  carefully read any of the additional information provided within each question. This additional information is often used  to prepare or guide the student when analysing the situation and may help them narrow their possible responses.</p>
<p align="left" class="examiner">  Students should have knowledge of the following data structures: one- and two-dimensional arrays, records and files, 
  stacks and queues. In this question, information was provided about what data would be stored, when it would be  stored, for how long it would be stored and in what order it would be deleted (oldest deleted first). This information was  to be used to select a suitable data structure (from the above list). </p>
<p align="left" class="examiner">Many students had difficulty identifying a data  structure and used programming terms that were not data structures. Students should have identified a queue as the  appropriate data structure, described it as 'first in first out' and explained that a stack, being 'last in first out', was not  appropriate in this situation (as the first data in was what should be removed).</p>

Checking to see that data exists within a limited list (e.g. days of the week, states of Australia, the names of Santa's reindeer) also fits under &quot;range check&quot; - but don't confuse &quot;existing within a limited list&quot; with an existence check.</span> <p align="left" class="examiner">An additional validation is recommended, which checks if the postcode is a valid Victorian postcode. Students were  asked to state how this would best be described. The question did not ask for the name of the validation technique that was suggested. One way of describing this test would be, 'it checks if the postcode is contained in the list of valid  Victorian postcodes'. A range of other responses was accepted.</p>

<td><p align="left"><strong>Question 12</strong></p>
<p align="left">  It will be necessary from time to time to update personal information for some of the asthmatics. It is thought that this will need to be done no more than three times a month for the life of the project. The code used to uniquely identify each asthmatic will be a simple number starting at 0001 and increasing to 1500. There are two possible ways that the AsthmaticsFile can be organised, either as serial access or as random access.</p>
<p align="left">  Ilma decides to use a random access file and use the asthmatics code to retrieve the record.<br />
Using <strong>two</strong> advantages that random access has over serial access in this situation, explain why she has made this decision. 4 marks</p>
<p align="left" class="myanswer">1. Random file access can be far faster that serial access since the starting point of records can be calculated mathematically and a record sought immediately without have to read all the intervening records.</p>
<p align="left" class="myanswer">2. Changing a record in a random file is as simple as locating it and writing its new values in its existing position (which is possible since all records are the same length). A serial file can only add records at the end of the file, so to change (say) record 5 of 1000, you must read the first 4 records from the existing file, write them to a new file, write the altered record 5, then read the next 995 records from the original file and write them to the new file. Then the old file needs to be closed, deleted, and the new file renamed with the original file's name.</p>
<p align="left" class="examiner">Random access versus serial access has appeared in a number of examinations over the last few years. However,  students still found it difficult to express their response in a detailed and clear manner. An appropriate response would  have included comments about ease of reading and/or writing random access files, would have compared these to serial  access and would have indicated why random access was appropriate in this scenario.</p>
<p align="left" class="examiner">For example: A sequential file would require the whole file to be read each time and then, after making the alterations,  the whole file would have to be rewritten. With a random access file, you can read just the record that you require and  rewrite just this record. In this case, you have the asthmatics code, which could be used to identify the record in a  random file, so access is no problem. You are doing this only infrequently, so you do not want to have to read the whole  file, just the record that you are interested in. Hence, random access would be much faster.</p>

<td><p align="left"><strong>Question 13</strong></p>
<p align="left">  The records in AsthmaticsFile will be kept in asthmatics code order (from lowest to highest). It will be necessary to find individual records by using the asthmatic's name. Anton suggests using a simple linear search, where you start at the first record and read each record until you find the one you want. Maria says that for 1500 records this will be too slow and argues that they should use a binary search.<br />
Which method is the more appropriate to use in this case and why? 2 marks</p>
<p align="left" class="myanswer">Since the data is sorted by code rather than name, it will not allow a binary search by name because the names are in random order. A linear search is the only alternative.</p>
<p align="left" class="examiner">In this question, students needed to indicate that a linear search (Anton's suggestion) was more appropriate and justify it  by explaining why a binary search would not work in this situation. The question required students to have in-depth  knowledge of the binary search technique. In the AsthmaticsFile, the records are not ordered according to the  asthmatic's name, so a binary search will not work as it requires the records to be ordered in the field you are searching  and the researchers plan to find records by using the asthmatic's name.</p>

<p align="left">  Asthmatics in the study will be mailed their pack one month prior to the commencement of the research. The pack contains their mobile phone (with the software solution pre-installed), the sensor and user documentation. The research team has insisted that all users of the system be provided with appropriate training in the use of the software module and the use and care of the sensor. The team also wants the asthmatics to undertake a short quiz at the end of the training to ensure that they have developed the necessary skills and knowledge to use the software and equipment. All of the training must be completed within four weeks of the asthmatics receiving their packs. As the 1500 asthmatics are located across all of Victoria, this will be a very difficult task to organise.</p>
