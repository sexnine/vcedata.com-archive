            <li>Some people get quite emotionally worked up when the issue of 'gender' arises. Be careful.</li>
            <li>Start with knowing some similar and confusing terms&hellip;.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The following definitions come from the Australian Government's Attorney-General's Department. (July 2013)</p>
          <h1><strong>Gender&nbsp;Inclusiveness</strong></h1>
          <ul>
            <li>"In 2013, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 was amended to introduce new protections from discrimination on the grounds of</li>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>sexual orientation</strong>,</li>
              <li><strong>gender identity&nbsp;</strong>and</li>
              <li><strong>intersex status&rdquo;</strong></li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <h4>There are now three official&nbsp;<strong>sexes</strong>&nbsp;recognised by Australian law:</h4>
          <ul>
            <ul>
              <ul>
                <li>male;</li>

                <li>intersex.</li>
              </ul>
            </ul>
            <li>Government guidelines say that "<em>Where sex and/or gender information is collected and recorded in a personal record, individuals should be given the option to select</em></li>
            <ul>
              <li><em>M (male),</em></li>
              <li><em>F (female) or</em></li>
              <li><em>X (Indeterminate / Intersex / Unspecified).</em>" </li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Note : the&nbsp;<em>Sex Discrimination Act&nbsp;</em>is not examinable.</li>
            <li>But remember that the collection, use, storage and disclosure of all personal information,&nbsp;including sex and gender information&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;regulated by the&nbsp;Privacy Act 1988" - which&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;examinable </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>But hang on&hellip;&nbsp;<strong>sex</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>gender</strong>&nbsp;are the same thing, aren&rsquo;t they?</li>
            <li>What do&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;think they mean?</li>
            <li><em>Discuss</em>. </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Sex</strong>&nbsp;- "refers to the chromosomal, gonadal and anatomical characteristics associated with biological sex.&rdquo;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>i.e. the hardware one is born with </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Gender</em>&nbsp;- "is part of a person&rsquo;s personal and social identity.</li>
            <li>It refers to the way a person feels, presents and is recognised within the community.</li>
            <li>A person&rsquo;s gender may be reflected in outward social markers, including their name, outward appearance, mannerisms and dress." </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li><em>Intersex -&nbsp;</em>"refers to people who are born with genetic, hormonal or physical sex characteristics that are not typically &lsquo;male&rsquo; or &lsquo;female&rsquo;.</li>
            <li>Intersex people have a diversity of bodies and gender identities, and may identify as male or female or neither." </li>
          </ul>
          <p><em>Just to confuse matters for you, the government's guidelines add that&hellip;</em></p>
          <ul>
            <li>"Although&nbsp;<em>sex</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>gender</em>&nbsp;are conceptually distinct, these terms are commonly used interchangeably, including in legislation.</li>
            <li>A person&rsquo;s sex and gender may not necessarily be the same.</li>
            <li>Some people may identify as a different gender to their birth sex and some people may identify as neither exclusively male nor female." </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>The guidelines say, "Individuals may have biological characteristics or undergo a variety of treatments that make it difficult to identify or define a person&rsquo;s true biological sex.</li>
            <li><strong>Sex can also be legally changed</strong>&nbsp;in Australian identity documents, including birth certificates."</li>
            <li>"<strong>Sex reassignment surgery</strong>&nbsp;and/or hormone therapy are not pre-requisites for the recognition of a change of gender in Australian Government records."</li>

          <h4><strong>Gender Inclusiveness Tips</strong></h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Don't assume readers are only either traditional males or females.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Gender involves shades of grey, not black and white.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Don't assume that readers will think a certain way because of the biological hardware with which they were born.</li>
            <li>Don't alienate readers based on their sex or gender. </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Don't assume that&nbsp;stereotypes&nbsp;are valid.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Pretty pink pastel colours for a webpage does not make "more it suitable for the girls."</li>
              <li>Not all men are emotionally tough and enjoy footy and a beer.</li>
              <li>Don't assign or assume stereotyped sex roles e.g. mechanics are male, a nurse must be female.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Wherever possible, do not even consider the sex or gender of readers.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>As soon as you do, you're in trouble. </li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
          <p>Avoid pronouns like "his" or "her". Instead of saying, "<em>A clever reader will know that his options are limited</em>." reword it:</p>
          <ul>
            <ul>
              <li>"A clever reader will know that&nbsp;<strong>his or her</strong>&nbsp;options are limited</li>
              <li>"Clever&nbsp;<strong>readers</strong>&nbsp;will know that&nbsp;<strong>their</strong>&nbsp;options are limited."</li>
              <li>"A clever reader will know that their options are limited.&ldquo; (it&rsquo;s grammatically-nasty, but its acceptance is growing) </li>

        <td ><h1><strong id="culture">Culture Inclusiveness</strong></h1>
          <p>A&nbsp;<strong>culture</strong>&nbsp;is a defining characteristic of a group of people based on their shared beliefs, history, attitudes, religious or political beliefs, preferences, habits, loves and hates, priorities, goals, etc. </p>

            <li>Be dominant, or a minority</li>
            <li>Be powerful or repressed</li>
            <li>Be repressive or liberal </li>
          </ul>
          <p>But&hellip;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>All members of a culture know what is expected of them if they are to be accepted or rejected.</li>
            <li>They embrace and defend shared beliefs</li>
            <li>They often work to maintain and develop their beliefs</li>
            <li>They learn and avoid the culture&rsquo;s taboos </li>

          <p>An exercise&hellip;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Choose a culture. Any culture.</li>

            <li>Describe how&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;might be affected if your MMOS offended members of a culture. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>When writing for a global audience&hellip;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>be aware that many or most readers will belong to cultures that may be slightly or completely differently to yours.</li>
            <li>Don't assume that all readers will understand the references you use that are based on your culture, for example local geographic or climatic characteristics, slang, vocabulary, history. </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>For example, the "nasty January temperatures" means very different things to people in the northern and southern hemispheres.</li>
            <li>Even saying "It reached 50 degrees" will mean different things to an Australian (thinking in degrees Celsius) and an American (thinking in degrees Fahrenheit). </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Carelessly assuming that everyone is like&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;and shares your knowledge and values can lead to a backlash that you never could have anticipated.</li>
            <li>If readers are annoyed or confused by what you say, they stop reading or listening.</li>

            <li>What would this statement mean to (for example) a schoolgirl in a Nigerian village? </li>
          </ul>
          <p>We often use expressions and vocabulary that are bound to our cultures, but these may not be understood by some, many or all other people.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use generic, simple, standard English.</li>
            <li>Avoid slang which may be meaningless or misunderstood.</li>
            <li>Keep sentences short and simple.</li>
            <li>Constrain your vocabulary (without being condescending.)</li>

          <ul>
            <li>have smaller vocabularies &ndash; they don&rsquo;t know the meanings of many words yet.</li>
