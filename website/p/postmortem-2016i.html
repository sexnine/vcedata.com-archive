 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="myanswer">Answer is probably going to be C but I bet half the state also goes for A. And I would agree with them.</p>
<p class="comment">VCAA has never defined what they think a storyboard looks like. The diagram is basically a site map with arrows attached. What do the arrows <em>mean</em>? I don't know. I can only guess they are meant to say 'This is no longer a site map.' </p>
<p class="comment">It's a bogus question examining key knowledge that is never defined by VCAA. Is an arrow significant? No such statement has been made by VCAA at any time.</p>
<p class="comment">The study design merely lists storyboards amongst other design tools, and the Informatics sample exam</a> (A15) again only mentions them as cousins of sitemaps.</p>
<p class="comment">It's another example of VCAA inventing its own conventions out of the blue and examining students on their invention. Even the stem is unsure - &quot;The diagram above <strong>most likely</strong> represents&quot; - aren't they even sure themselves?</p>
<p class="comment">The markers had better accept either A or C or I will be very displeased.</p>

 Bentwood Softball Club needs to ensure that all of its umpires are registered to umpire games in Victoria. To do this, the club needs to record detailed personal information regarding each umpire's level of skill. Recently, the club undertook an online survey of all of its 35 umpires.<br />
 The safest way for Bentwood Softball Club to store the data from the survey is on</p>
 <p><strong>
     a. </strong> the club's &lsquo;members only' social media page.<br /><strong>
       b. </strong> an unsecured web page on the club's website.<br /><strong>
        c.</strong> a DVD kept on an open shelf in the clubrooms.<br /><strong>

 <p>For the Gantt chart shown above, a delay in the completion of Task D by one day will<br /><strong>
a. </strong> have no effect on Task E.<br /><strong>
b. </strong> delay only Task E by one day.<br /><strong>
 c.</strong> delay only Task F by one day.<br /><strong>
 d.</strong> delay both tasks E and F by one day. </p>
 <p class="myanswer">Answer is A.</p>
<p class="explanation">If Task D overruns by 1 day, dependent task F starts one day late, <strong>and its dependent task G <em>also</em> starts one day late</strong>. Hence option (C) does not work because it says that <strong>only</strong> Task F is delayed.</p>
<p class="explanation"> Task E  is dependent on F, but there is a day's slack so E is not affected. </p>
<p class="comment"><img src="/m/pm/16i-a11-gantt1.png" width="667" height="228" alt="VCE Informatics exam 2016"/></p>

        c. </strong>a biometric reader<br /><strong>
      d. </strong>antivirus software? </p>
     <p class="myanswer">Answer is B.</p>
  <p class="explanation">A switch (A) only connects cables within a LAN. It does not assess the credentials of packets of data. <br />
    A firewall (B) stands between a LAN and outsiders, and actively inspects data transfers to ensure they are legitimate and allowed.<br />
    (C) is just silly. The exam writer obviously ran out of cunning distractors.<br />
    Antivirus software (D) does not examine the source of incoming data, only its contents.<br />

     <p><img src="/m/pm/16i-a13b.png" width="497" height="542" alt="VCE Informatics exam 2016"/></p>
     <p class="myanswer">Answer is A.</p>
  <p class="explanation">It looks scary at the start, but sketch a quick schema based on common sense. <br />
    All options have the same 3 tables, so no decision needed there.<br />
    The problem with (B) is that the <strong>duration</strong> is related to APPOINTMENT, not DENTIST. A quick first victim to rule out.<br />
    (C) links the patient's <strong>whole</strong> name in one table with the <strong>FirstName</strong> in another table. Another quick loser. <br />
    The relationships in (D) are fine, but the <strong>Duration</strong> is now in the PATIENT table, to which is doesn't belong. Also <strong>PatientName</strong> is two names in a single field and that violates 1NF. Can't be that, then.<br />
  </p>
     <p class="comment">A challenging way to test 3NF and relationship key knowledge in one go. Shame it's only worth 1 mark.</p>
     <p class="comment">But why are AppointmentDate and AppointmentTime <u>underlined</u> as if they were <strong>keys</strong>? The only <strong>other</strong> underlined fields are keys!</p>
     <p class="comment"><strong>Shame</strong> on the examiners for breaking their own rules. Go sit on the naughty step and think about your sloppy proof-reading and confusing inconsistency.</p>
     <hr />
     <p class="comment">Soon after...</p>
     <p class="comment">A worthy colleague has reminded me that the underlined fields may well be acting as a multi-field primary key for the appointments table!</p>
     <p class="comment">That is technically feasible. Grrr.</p>
     <p class="comment">But why would <strong>anyone</strong> in their right mind create a multiple-field key after all we've learned about 2NF problems? It's just dumb database design! </p>
     <p class="comment">I never even consider using multiple-field keys, any more than I would consider checking for gas leaks by striking a match.</p>
     <p class="comment">All right. I <strong>withdraw</strong> my complaint about the redundant underlining, and <strong>replace</strong> it with a complaint about setting a bad example to impressionable young database designers.</p>
     <p class="comment">Any depiction of multiple-field keys in exams should be accompanied by compulsory health warnings.</p>

a. </strong> age appropriate and gender inclusive.<br /><strong>
b. </strong> appropriate for all ages and gender inclusive.<br /><strong>

 d.</strong> suitable for young people only and culturally inclusive. </p>
 <p class="myanswer">Answer is A.</p>
<p class="explanation">Not all information needs to be appropriate for <strong>all</strong> ages: it needs to suit the ages at which it is targeted. Rule out B because it would not allow discussion of any 'adult' careers such as exotic dancing, or portraying Santa in a supermarket at Christmas.<br />
  Rule out C quickly - cultural <strong>ex</strong>clusivity is never an aim unless... no. Let's not bring Donald Trump or Pauline Hanson into this.<br />

   <p> Greenwood Council is developing a disaster recovery plan.<br />
 What is the best management strategy to enable the restoration of data quickly with the least loss of data?</p>
   <p><strong>
       a. </strong> Implement weekly full backups.<br /><strong>
        b. </strong> Implement only daily incremental backups.<br /><strong>
        c.</strong> Implement daily incremental and weekly full backups.<br /><strong>
        d.</strong> Implement daily incremental and weekly incremental backups.</p>
 <p class="myanswer">Answer is C.</p>
<p class="explanation">I've never heard of a weekly incremental backup. It sounds impressive, and may be designed to distract weaker students. <br />
  Option C is the current standard for backups, but is increasingly being displaced by continuous data backups (CDB) to the cloud.</p>
 <p class="comment">I'm really glad the examiners did not roll out 'differential backups' just to muddy the waters.</p>
 <p class="comment">I thought the abbreviated wording of options C and D was not good for ESL students. It would have better been expressed as<br />
   &quot;Implement daily incremental BACKUPS and (other) BACKUPS.&quot;<br />
   </p>
 <p class="comment">Otherwise, what is a &quot;daily incremental&quot;? </p>

 <p><br />
 A school's administration is reviewing its information management strategy based on the following criteria: security, cost, speed of data retrieval and currency of data.<br />
 Taking into account all of the criteria, which of the following is the best information management strategy to enable the urgent restoration of data?<br />
 </p>
 <p><img src="/m/pm/16i-a16.png" width="572" height="246" alt="VCE Informatics exam 2016"/></p>
 <p class="myanswer">Answer is B.</p>
<p class="explanation">The answer depends on judging the relative importance of different criteria. <br />
  Cost is the least relevant, so ignore it at first because the question focuses on the <strong>urgent</strong> restoration of data, which depend on the last 2 criteria.<br />
  And - contrary to the speed issue - <strong>currency of data</strong> is more important than retrieval speed. Retrieving outdated data quickly is pointless. </p>
<p class="explanation">(A) and (D) are unreliable because they are only only current now and then.<br />
  (B) may be slow, but at least it's always up to date.<br />
  (C) is only up to date once a week, so it's pretty worthless.<br />
</p>
 <p class="explanation"><strong>Thanks for the feedback from a couple of clever people who helped improve this answer!</strong></p>

   <p>       The photograph editor for a magazine publisher is setting up a folder structure for a new project based on the following conditions:</p>
   <ol>
     <li> Several photographers will be sending original photographs to the editor during the next three months. <br />
       At the end of the project, each photographer's full set of original photographs will have to be easily identified. <br />
       The originals will never be manipulated but will need to be archived at the end of the project.</li>
     <li>When a photograph is to be manipulated, the editor will make a copy of the original. The copy will be manipulated as needed. There may be many different versions saved. These will require daily backup.</li>
     <li> The final photographs that are accepted for publication will need to be sent as a batch to the publishing team. They will also need to be archived at the end of the project.</li>
     </ol>
   <p class="comment">[Note - I have changed the criteria dotpoints to numbers to make discussion easier]</p>

 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p class="myanswer">Answer is D.</p>
<p class="explanation">Rule out B immediately since it cannot accomplish identification of the photographer (criterion 1).<br />
  Let's proceed through the criteria to see which other options fail to make the grade.</p>
<p class="explanation">Criterion 1 - options A, C and D all keep all original files identifiable by their photographer.</p>
<p class="explanation">Criterion 2 - the 'daily backup' of versions of copies would be easier if all of them were in a single folder, such as (D). Otherwise, a backup would need to search each photographer's working copy files folder individually, which is a pain. D is looking good.</p>
<p class="explanation">Criterion 3 - again, to send the final photos as a batch, it would be easiest if they were all in the same folder as a group. Option (D) again achieves that. This is not to say that (C) would not be possible, but it would be less <em>efficient</em> (in terms of labour and time) - the main point of the question.<br />

     <p> PMC needs a storage capacity of 20 GB per day for its client data, while BOS needs 5 MB per day for its membership data.<br />
       Which pair of options will provide the best backup plan for both organisations?<br />
      </p>
     <p><img src="/m/pm/16i-a18.png" width="658" height="240" alt="VCE Informatics exam 2016"/></p>
     <p class="myanswer">Answer is C.</p>
  <p class="explanation">It was pretty quick and easy to eliminate options just by looking just at PMC's column.<br />
    (A) the external HDD was OK, but backing up only once a week is a deal-breaker.<br />
    (B) DVD is not wise, since it can only hold 4.7GB, is easily scratched, is relatively slow 
  to burn data to, is not reusable unless it's read/write, is believed to decay over time. Oh, yes. And it's stored onsite, which rules it out immediately.<br />
  (C) Tape is OK. Yes - 
  shock, horror - tape is still widely used in industry and can still whoop HDD's backside when it comes to speed and capacity. Daily backups are good. Tapes stored offsite - all good.<br />
  (D) The SSD in itself is worth considering, but the &quot;stored in office, open to all staff&quot; is dangerous.</p>
  <p class="explanation">So (C) looks good so far so let's check the other column for (C). Automatic backup to the cloud is worthy of consideration. The 1Mbps is OK (assuming that is the upload speed - not so good if it's the download speed.     </p>
  <p class="comment">I wish exams would tie up loose like this. It makes a considerable difference - if the <strong>download</strong> speed were only 1Mbps, it might take ages to restore one day's data. The question could have cleared up this ambiguity with only a word or two.<br />
  </p>
  <p class="comment">Tip: &quot;ADSL&quot; stands for Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line, and the key word is &quot;Asymmetric&quot; which means that the upload and download speeds are significantly different. Quoting a single speed when there are in fact two is incomplete and confusing.</p>
     <p class="explanation">So (C) stands up in both columns.</p>
     <p class="explanation">Just for fun (yeah, I know, I don't get out much, so discussing the merits of unsatisfactory backup methods is my idea of fun) let's check out the remaining options.</p>
     <p class="explanation">In the BOS column...<br />
       (A) internal HDD
     is fast and capacious, but very difficult to take offsite at the end of each day.<br />
     (B) a <strong>read-only</strong> DVD? How are you going to write data to a read-only DVD?? Weird.<br />
     (D) flash drives are convenient and very portable, but not hugely
     reliable. 32GB could store 6 days' data, which is not really enough. And it's only a weekly backup, which is once again a dangerous strategy.</p>

 <p> PMC has decided to replace its current backup strategy with cloud storage. It is aware of the need to dispose of data when clients' records are no longer required. PMC has a number of options:<br />
 1. Crush the old flash drives and place them in the garbage.<br />
 2. Delete backup files from the old flash drives before re-using them.<br />
 3. Delete data from cloud storage that is no longer needed.<br />
 4. Ensure that the contract with the cloud company requires it to dispose of the data PMC no longer needs.<br />
 </p>
 <p>Which pair of options should PMC choose to ensure old data is disposed of properly?</p>
 <p><strong>
     a. </strong> 1 and 3<br /><strong>
       b. </strong> 2 and 4<br /><strong>
        c. </strong>1 and 4<br /><strong>
        d. </strong>2 and 3 <br />
 </p>
 <p class="myanswer">Answer is A.</p>
<p class="explanation">This is a chewy question, unlike the previous one. As with all section A questions, one should look for patterns. Each option referred to one of the first two methods (both of which deal with the old backups), and one of the second two methods (which both relate to new cloud-based backups).</p>
<p class="explanation">Looking at the methods:</p>
<p class="explanation">(1) Obviously crushing old flash drives is an extreme, but 100% effective way of destroying data on them. Cost is not an issue nowadays since 8GB drives are nearly valueless.<br />
  (2) Simply deleting files does not make them unrecoverable. Some data may not be overwritten for some considerable time. This is a risky strategy. Rule out options B and D that select it.<br />
  (3) Deleting data from cloud storage is a good idea. I would have lingering doubts about how well it was actually deleted, since cloud files may be replicated on many physical servers, and the reliability of the cloud host may mean 'deleted' files are still accessible to the wrong people. Still, it's better than...<br />
  (4) A contract means little if the host is incompetent or untrustworthy. And how would the host know which data is no longer required by PMC? So this option also drops out.</p>
<p class="explanation">That leaves only option A. </p>

   I've noticed a recent tendency
   for section A questions to require much more reading and thought to answer, e.g. A17. This is welcome to a degree, but remember the ESL kids will be struggling with page-long questions, and most students will be taking several minutes to earn a single mark.<br />
   On the other hand, several of the questions (such as A10 and A19) had ridiculously absurd options that 
   provided no challenge whatsoever. Is it a good VCE exam if someone could walk in off the street and earn several marks without any Informatics study at all?<br />

     <ul>
       <li class="myanswer">It removes much repetition of data, such as names, addresses that could be stored just once in a relational database. This would make the database smaller and more responsive.</li>
       <li class="myanswer">It reduces the risk of invalid data being stored - e.g. if a customer moves house, the address stored in previous records would become incorrect, while yet others would be correct. This loss of integrity makes the whole database unreliable.</li>
       <li class="myanswer">More data would be accessible. The use of relationships greatly increases the number of ways data can be searched, manipulated and arranged.</li>
       <li class="myanswer">Data entry would be far faster, since repeated data (e.g. name, address) would not need to be entered for each item sold.<br />

 <p class="comment">Hang on a minute! The question did not specify that the 'preferred method of referencing' had to be one of the four in the study design. LOOPHOLE! </p>
 <p class="comment">But seriously, folks, this was far from easy for the average student. Getting each comma, italic (have you ever tried to handwrite in italics?), and quotation mark right is a big ask - especially for a website reference, which is arguably trickier than a reference to a book.</p>
 <p class="comment">I hope the markers are allowed a fair amount of latitude when awarding marks. Nevertheless, I predict the state average will be about 0.5 / 2 or less.</p>

 Please remove from the centre of this book during reading time. <br />
 </p>
 <p align="left"><strong>InformUs</strong><br />
   InformUs is a large marketing company in Melbourne. Bill is the manager of the telemarketing department and he is in charge of all the telemarketers in the company.<br />
   The telemarketers work between the hours of 5 pm and 8 pm, when more people are likely to be at home. They travel to the office in the late afternoon, log in to the system, download a list of telephone numbers and start making calls to participants to obtain their opinions on various products. Each participant's responses are written on a paper copy of the survey by the telemarketer.<br />
   <strong>Issue</strong><br />
   Bill is finding it very difficult to attract and retain telemarketers for the company. He believes that this is because many potential telemarketers do not want to travel into the city each evening for only a few hours' work.<br />
   At a recent managers' meeting, Bill discussed the problem with Mary, the manager of the marketing department. She suggested that Bill look into allowing his staff to work from home via the internet as a way of making it more appealing and to attract and retain telemarketers.<br />
   <strong>Proposal</strong><br />
   Bill has put together a proposal for setting up a new system that will allow his telemarketers to work from home.<br />
   Bill's proposed new system has four main parts:<br />
   &bull; Telemarketers who choose to work from home will be given a laptop, a headset and a high-speed broadband connection of at least 12 Mbps for their home internet.<br />
   &bull; At the start of each shift, the telemarketer will remotely log in to the company network as a virtual private network (VPN) client and access their list of telephone numbers to call.<br />
   &bull; Telemarketers will make telephone calls using a voice over internet protocol (VoIP) system through the company network.<br />
   &bull; The information collected by the telemarketers will be entered straight into a database via a web-based user interface. The database will be stored on the InformUs file server.<br />
   During his research for his proposal, Bill formed a hypothesis: &lsquo;If the telemarketers were allowed to work from home, they would have greater levels of satisfaction. This would lead to higher retention levels (fewer people leaving the company) and fewer sick days being taken. Overall, the telemarketing department would perform better and this would be good for the company.'<br />
   To get approval for his proposed new system, Bill must demonstrate to the Board of Directors that his hypothesis is well informed and correct. His supervisor has told him that he must have a report regarding his proposal ready for the Board by 23 December. The report will be placed on the company's VPN for the Board to access and will be password protected.<br />
   To test his hypothesis, Bill must collect data about whether the telemarketers would prefer to work from home. To do this, he decides to undertake an online survey of all the telemarketers.<br />

     <p class="comment">Straightforward enough. It was good to see the clear explanation of which tasks could be concurrent. </p>
     <p class="explanation">But, as Jack from Yesodie noticed, something fishy is going on. With most corporate Gantts, the default setting is that Saturdays and Sundays are non-work days, and the question pointed out that Bill does not work on weekends. So at first I went ahead and set the duration of task B to 7 days - as one would. The problem is that noone said that the telemarketers could not reply to the survey on weekends, so I had a problem: most tasks could not use weekends, but one <strong>did</strong>. That made the critical path 2 days longer than the space allowed by the examiners in their empty Gantt. </p>
     <p class="explanation">I consulted the GanttProject forum, and found that individual tasks could not be set to different weekend rules. Since I could not find a way to set a single task as weekend-enabled, I  had to fudge it by setting the duration of task B to <strong>five</strong> days - a messy, icky solution.</p>
     <p class="explanation">Doing the chart on the exam paper, it would have been easy to count the days and make different tasks follow different rules.</p>
     <p class="explanation"><img src="/m/pm/16i-c1-gantt-hand.png" width="633" height="232" alt="VCE Informatics exam 2016"/></p>
     <p class="explanation"> Using software made a royal mess out of it. I don't know what the moral of this story is. </p>
     <p class="explanation">I've been pondering it and decided that task B is <strong>not</strong> actually a task and should <strong>not</strong> be represented as a task. <br />
       Bill is not involved in carrying it out. No resources are assigned to it. It's more of an <strong>event</strong> that delays task C. <br />
       So it should somehow be represented as maybe lag time for task A, or a dummy task - concepts that go far beyond what students are expected to know about project management. </p>
     <p class="explanation">I've decided that if this was a deliberate inclusion, it's <strong>a dirty and unfair trick</strong>.<br />
       If it's an oversight by the writer of the question, it's <strong>careless overcomplication</strong>.<br />
     </p>
     <p class="explanation">Tip: when you get a Gantt in future exams, I suggest you lightly colour in the weekends with a pencil or highlighter so you don't forget to treat them with care.</p>

 </p>
   <p align="left">While Bill is preparing his survey questions for Task A, he has an idea. He should interview some of his telemarketers face-to-face, rather than have them complete the online survey. He could digitally record the interviews and use the recordings to create a multimodal online report, rather than preparing just a text- and image-based report.</p>
 <p> Bill thinks it will take a day to digitally record the interviews and he will have to add a day to the time it takes to prepare the multimodal online report. Bill would like his idea to have as little impact as possible on his project's timeline.</p>
 <p><strong>
a. </strong> From your Gantt chart on page 18 [<span class="explanation">of the printed exam</span>], suggest the best date for Bill to conduct the face-to-face interviews in relation to the other tasks. Explain how your suggestion minimises the impact of the interviews on the overall project timeline.</p>
 <p> Suggested date <br />
 </p>
 <p class="myanswer">7 December</p>
 <p>Explanation </p>
 <p class="myanswer">By the 7th, he has finished the search for online sources and is idle while telemarketers respond. He can use this slack time for the new task.</p>
 <p class="explanation">'Slack time' is not strictly an examinable term, but I highly recommend you become familiar with the concept.<br />
   For the record, slack time is the amount of time by which a task is shorter than a longer concurrent task. </p>
 
 
 <p><strong>b. </strong> Taking into account your suggested date in part a. and the extra time needed to prepare the multimodal online report, describe the overall impact of Bill's idea on the project timeline. <br clear="all" />
 </p>
 <p class="myanswer">The project will take one extra day. </p>
 <p class="explanation">The interviews do not affect the end date, but the extra day needed to finish the report pushes the end date back by one day. <br />

  &bull; How important is being at home to care for a sick family member?<br />
   </p>
 <p align="left"><strong>a.</strong> Describe a way Bill could arrange for the responses to these questions to be coded to support manipulation once the survey is closed. 2 marks</p>
 <p align="left" class="myanswer">Assuming the answers are free-form, open-ended and text-based (i.e. people answer using whatever words they like) - which is the only reason coding of the responses would be necessary - Bill could create a translation list such as:</p>
 <ul>
   <li class="myanswer">Phrases like &quot;Not much&quot;, &quot;Not really&quot;, &quot;Hardly at all&quot;, &quot;Very little&quot; etc - all get coded as 'Limited extent'</li>

 <p class="myanswer">A higher occurrence of 'Great Extent' responses for those questions that affect respondents personally and would contribute to their wellbeing?</p>
 <p class="explanation">In other words, all three questions!<br />
   I don't know what other sort of pattern he should expect to see.<br />
   Maybe he would expect a pattern whereby respondents with no family often say &quot;Limited extent&quot; for the third question??</p>
 <p class="comment">This question is a bit like the old annoying 'Guess what the examiner's thinking' questions. It's clear the writer of the question had a particular pattern in mind and wanted students to see it too.</p>

</p>
   <p>Mary, the marketing manager, has come up with an idea to help cut costs. She has proposed that her online marketing department use email to contact InformUs' participants rather than the telemarketing department calling participants individually.<br />
     Under Mary's plan, participants would complete a survey online and the results would be saved to the cloud rather than on the database on InformUs' file server.<br />

   <p>Explain <strong>one</strong> benefit of minimising risk for the InformUs information management strategy that Mary's proposal would have. </p>
   <p class="comment">To begin with, I don't understand the question. <br />
     It is asking how the proposal will minimise risk to the strategy?<br />
     Or is it asking for a benefit of minimising risk?</p>
   <p class="comment">Or is it clumsily asking for a benefit of cloud storage over local database storage?</p>
   <p class="comment">     And which particular 'strategy' is the question referring to? The <strong>existing</strong> strategy of phoning participants from the city call centre? The <strong>proposed</strong> strategy of telemarketers phoning participants from their homes and sending data via the VPN?<br />
     And can a <strong>strategy</strong> even face risks, like an information management <strong>system</strong> does? </p>
   <p class="comment">     I don't know how students interpreted the question. I particularly feel sorry for the ESL kids trying to work out what on earth it means.</p>
   <p class="explanation">Here's an answer:</p>
   <p class="myanswer">One benefit of minimising risk for the information management strategy is that having <strong>less risk</strong> will make the strategy safer.</p>
   <p class="explanation">There. I think that does it. Two marks, please.</p>
   <p class="explanation">     When students find a question ambiguous or confusing, I advise them to try to read the examiner's 
     mind and work out what the semantically-deficient question was <strong>probably trying to ask</strong>. <br />
     If that doesn't work, answer <strong>both</strong> potential meanings, for example, &quot;If the question is asking X then my answer is Y. But if the question is asking Q then my answer is Z.&quot;</p>
   <p class="explanation">In this case, however, I can't even confidently <strong>guess</strong> what the examiner is trying to say. It's a double-headed failure.   <br />

     <p class="comment">VCAA has said that there will be no prescribed format for UFDs. <br />
       So, I'm curious whether this diagram will quietly become an unofficially-official template for UFDs in exams.<br />
       Or will the next exam UFD be very different in structure/appearance/format? <br />
       I await with bated breath to find out.</p>
     <p class="comment">   But if VCAA ever examines students on the detailed nature of the arrows,  shapes, shading, underlining, or  structure of an unpublished, unofficial and arbitrary UFD format that they've invented in a back room just for an exam, I will be mightily cross.<br />
       If they want to examine students on a diagram's intricate formatting details, they must create a canonical style guide, as they did with <a href="http://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/Documents/vce/computing/Informatics_examination_ER_Conventions.docx">their ERD</a>.<br />

     <p class="comment">Remember that - unlike the study design - <strong>VCAA exams are not themselves part of the examinable canon. </strong><br />
       They may develop a tradition and precedent (as the style of pseudocode has become in SD exams), but exams cannot define new key knowledge or make a particular formatting style choice <strong>official</strong>.<br />

   Thank the divine Labrador that the exam did not decide to examine students on the messy and artificial problems of 2NF. I hope they forever remember that 2NF problems are  completely preventable by using dedicated a key field for each table.
