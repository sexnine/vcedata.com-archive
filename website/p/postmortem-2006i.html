Which one of the following would be the best way of organising an email archive for a small publishing company? </p>

<p><em>Probably <strong>&lt;D&gt;</strong>. All of the options are feasible, but there is never a folder structure that is always right for everyone: a good folder structure needs to support the way you will search for files later. </em></p>
<p><em>It's a bit like storing shoes: should you line them up according to colour or style? If you always choose your shoes according to style, having them organised by colour is not helpful. On the other hand if you always choose your shoes based on the colour of the clothes you're wearing that day then having the shoes sorted by style is useless. How to store stuff efficiently always depends how you will search the stuff later. </em></p>
<p><em>But some schemes are more likely to be used that others. How many libraries have you seen where the books are organised by size rather than by topic or author? </em></p>
<p><em>Obviously, organising by year is a logical way to classify emails, assuming you later know what year to search in! Organising by department is also logical if you know you'll search for emails by department. It's not really clear from the case study which they will find most convenient. &lt;D&gt; gives the best structure for finding emails quickly, if you know the year and department. &lt;A&gt; would probably result in an uncomfortably large lump of emails in each folder. &lt;B&gt; offers less organisation than &lt;D&gt;. Option &lt;C&gt; is vague and would make email hunting frustrating. </em></p>

<strong>D. communication of the message, presentation, accessibility </strong>*</p>
<p class="myanswer" >Hmmm, tricky. The hyperlink in &lt;B&gt; is rubbish so cross that out immediately. &quot;Functionality&quot; refers to how many jobs the product is capable of, and that doesn't really apply to printed things, so both &lt;A&gt; and &lt;C&gt; are a bit dodgy. That leaves &lt;D&gt;: communication of the message is obviously important, presentation is critical in printed publications, but what about accessibility? It has a specialist meaning relating to how well it caters for people with special needs (blind, poor motor skills etc). To me &quot;accessibility&quot; has a secondary sense of &quot;being able to be accessed&quot; (e.g. does a network user have the rights to enter a folder to get the document; is it password protected or encrypted to stop someone accessing it?) Is accessibility a big deal in this case study? Not really, but colour-blind men might have trouble reading it if its colours were unwisely selected. Still &lt;D&gt;is
better than the others so I'll take it. </p>

<p class="myanswer"><em>Oooh, the examiners are getting frisky and imaginative in the dying days of IPM! This is a nice, challenging question. Let's eliminate some easy victims...</em></p>
<p class="myanswer"><em>It can't be &lt;A&gt; because you would not test formulas after entering sales.<br />
It won't likely be &lt;C&gt; because formulas are not tested at all. Two down, two to go!<br />
So, what's the difference between &lt;B&gt; and &lt;D&gt;? &lt;D&gt; establishes validation rules way too late. That should be done early... so &lt;B&gt; looks good.</em></p>
<p class="myanswer"><em>Let's justify &lt;B&gt; then. So far we have not had to check the predecessors, but we should do that before accepting &lt;B&gt;. Task 4 is dependent on predecessor task 3 - makes sense. You <strong>can't</strong>* test formulas before they're entered. Entering sales is dependent on the previous 4 tasks, OK. Final calculation is dependent on everything before... I can believe that.</em> </p>
<p class="myanswer">* Please forgive earlier typo that said &quot;<strong>Can</strong> test&quot; Buggerit! </p>
<p class="myanswer"><em>To back up the decision of &lt;B&gt;, notice that &lt;D&gt; allows data entry before validation rules are defined. This is not good. &lt;D&gt; is definitely out. </em></p>
<p class="myanswer"><em>As a double check, a quick look at the other options' predecessors reveal problems, e.g. &lt;C&gt; enters sales even if the input screen is not finished! </em></p>

<p><b>Question </b><b>3</b></p>
<p>At Safety Secondary College students are required to purchase a 256 MB memory stick (flash drive) to backup their own files.</p>
<p>The college has the following current backup strategy for the student data file server.</p>
<p>Each Friday afternoon at 2.00 pm the technician bums three DVD RWs, one for Years 7 and 8, one for Years 9 and 10, and one for Years 11 and 12, on which he stores all files that have been changed during the week. These DVD RWs are stored at the technician's home. The technician has two sets of three DVD RWs which he reburns alternately.</p>
<p>Explain and justify <b>three </b>changes you would make to this strategy. 6 marks / 6 lines per change (state average was 59%) </p>
<p>Let's break it down...</p>
<p>Each Friday afternoon -<span class="myanswer"> not often enough. Should be a full backup weekly with incremental backups daily. Reason: up to a week's worth of data could be lost otherwise.</span> </p>
<p>at 2.00 pm - <span class="myanswer">should be automated and set to start about 4am. Reason: if files are in use, they are locked and cannot be backed up. A backup at 2pm will also slow down the network.</span></p>
<p>the technician burns three DVD RWs - <span class="myanswer">should use DAT tape. Reason: avoids having to be present to manually feed in DVDs. DAT tape is reliable and cost-effective. </span></p>
<p>one for Years 7 and 8, one for Years 9 and 10, and one for Years 11 and 12, on which he stores all files that have been changed during the week - <span class="myanswer">needs a full backup weekly. Reason: to do a full restore, a recent image of the entire server is needed as a starting point, upon which the following days' incremental backups are overlaid. </span></p>
<p>These DVD RWs are stored at the technician's home. The technician has two sets of three DVD RWs which he reburns alternately. <span class="myanswer">Needs to adopt a grandfather-father-son backup strategy whereby full and incremental backups and tape rotation mean data can be resurrected way in the future. Reason: the current strategy overwrites the data too soon. If data loss is not discovered within 2 weeks, recovery is impossible. </span> </p>

<p>Adding new songs to your digital music player could become as easy as passing someone in the street. Push Music (a new software package) automatically transfers copies of songs between Wi-Fi enabled MP3 players when they come within 20 metres of each other.<br />
When two or more Push Music users come within Wi-Fi range, their MP3 players set up a 'conference' that allows them to exchange music files. To ensure people end up with songs they are likely to enjoy, each MP3 file is accompanied by a data file containing information about the song and how often it is played.</p>

<p>Woodrow Secondary College produces a printed school magazine. A group of senior students uses a variety of equipment to acquire text and images for the magazine. </p>
<p><b>a. </b>Identify and explain <b>two </b>technical problems the students are likely to face when manipulating the images that are chosen for the magazine. 4 marks (state average was 33%) </p>
<p class="myanswer">- storing large images: to be printed at high resolution, the digital images will necessarily be in very large files. The storage device would need to have a healthy capacity.</p>
<p class="myanswer">- communicating images: if the images had to be sent from student to student, or to the printing company, they could easily exceed the maximum size allowable for email attachments and may need to be burned to CD or DVD.</p>
<p class="myanswer">- editing very large images consumes a lot of processor power and RAM, and an underpowered computer could well work very sluggishly or perhaps not be able to load the image at all.</p>
<p class="myanswer">- they might need to convert the image from one digital file format to another (e.g. TIFF to JPG)</p>
<p class="myanswer">- for printing they might have to convert the image from RGB colour to CMYK. </p>
<p><b>b. </b>Identify and explain <b>one </b>manipulation process the editor might use to make an image fit into a set space in<b> </b>the magazine. 2 marks (state average was 63%) </p>
<p class="myanswer">Cropping - unwanted edge parts of the image are deleted.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Resizing - the vertical and horizontal number of pixels in the image are changed proportionally (increased or reduced) to make the image a different size. Resizing usually means &quot;reducing&quot; because enlarging any raster image will result in a decrease in quality . </p>
<p><b>c. </b>Each image in the magazine must be labelled, and these labels are located in the text caption files. List <b>two </b>instructions the students should be given about the naming of the images' files and the associated text captions' files. Give a filename example for each instruction. 4 marks (state average was 59%) </p>
<p class="myanswer"><em>This is quite a strange and confusing question - the caption files are hard to work out. &quot;Text caption FILES&quot; - why more than one file? Is each caption in a single file, so there is one caption file for each picture file? How incredibly dim that would be! </em></p>
<p>Instruction for image file</p>
<p class="myanswer">File names must have an extension indicating the filetype (e.g. TIF, JPG)</p>
<p class="myanswer">Do not use spaces in filenames - use a dash or underscore or no character instead . e.g. Soccer_Team.jpg </p>
<p class="myanswer">Filenames should either be meaningful (e.g. Soccer-Team.jpg) or organised with a naming pattern (e.g. StaffPix05.jpg, SwimSports12.tif)</p>
<p>Instruction for text caption file</p>
<p class="myanswer">Assuming there is one caption file for each photograph file (the case study is unclear about this), the caption file name must correspond with the photograph filename, so <span class="style8">Soccer_Team.jpg</span> should have a corresponding <span class="style8">Soccer_team.txt</span> file.</p>

<p><b>Question 11</b></p>
<p>Fast and Furious Couriers guarantee twenty-four hour delivery anywhere within Victoria.<b> </b>In the last year the sending of bills to customers has been delayed because signed delivery dockets are not returned until Friday when all couriers return to the office.</p>
<p><b>a. </b>Identify the problem experienced by Fast and Furious Couriers. 1 mark (state average was 40%) </p>
<p class="myanswer">The information required for billing is not timely. They need the delivery docket data when it's needed for prompt billing. (?) </p>
<p><em>Huh? This question could be answered in many ways. The instructions in the question are too vague and can be easily misinterpreted. </em></p>
<p>New Solutions has recommended that Fast and Furious Couriers give all drivers Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs). The PDA will allow a driver to electronically scan the customer signature and send the signature via the mobile phone network. The PDA will also allow text messages containing pick-up and delivery addresses to be sent to drivers notifying them of their next job rather than using a two-way radio.</p>
<p><b>b. </b>Identify and explain two time efficiencies which would be gained from New Solutions' recommendations. 4 marks (state average was 60%) </p>
<p class="myanswer">Since drivers do not need to store dockets, protect dockets and deliver the delivery dockets to head office, they can save time by concentrating on driving to the next job. </p>
<p class="myanswer">The dockets arrive at head office as the deliveries are made, allowing billing to begin immediately after a job is completed. </p>
<p>Don't discuss other efficiency matters like saving money on two-way radios. The question is <strong>time</strong> efficiency, not cost efficiency. </p>
<p><b>c. </b>Describe one method for evaluating if the system saves time for the drivers. 1 mark (state average was 55%) </p>
<p class="myanswer">Count the number of deliveries made by drivers before and after getting the PDAs. If they make more deliveries on average, they must be spending less time on each delivery.</p>
<p><em>This is a little more realistic than getting a man with a clipboard and a stopwatch timing the deliveries made by a driver during the course of week.

<p><b>Question 12</b></p>
<p>Star Movies is an independent chain of cinemas located in Victoria<b>. </b>An employee works at the ticket counter for 4 hours each day and at other times tickets are sold at the candy bar. The manager has seen a new touch-screen ticketing machine that will allow movie goers to use cash or a credit card to pay for their ticket after selecting the movie, session and type of ticket on the touch screen. The ticket still needs to be handed to an attendant to enter the cinema.</p>
<p>Candy? CANDY? This is AU-bloody-STRALIA. We have <strong>lollies</strong>. Not candy! Grrr! </p>
<p><b>a. </b>Identify and explain one cost efficiency the manager could gain by implementing this system. 2 marks (state average was 73%) </p>
<p class="myanswer">The employee could keep selling lollies while customers bought their tickets, thereby increasing the profit from lollies.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Since customers would find it more convenient to buy a ticket using the machine, their numbers might increase and improve revenue from ticket sales.</p>
<p class="myanswer">If the employee is embezzling ticket money, this would be prevented by using the honest machine. </p>
<p><em>This last suggestion is a deliberately VERY 'iffy' one. Avoid suggestions that are unlikely or unrealistic. Only make assumptions like this if the case study suggests it <strong>might</strong> be possible. ALWAYS put the certain ideas down before resorting to speculative imagination. <strong>Remember that common sense is your number one friend in IT exams.</strong> </em></p>
<p>The manager has decided to install the new touch-screen ticketing system.</p>
<p><b>b.</b> Recommend and justify a method of changing over to the new system. 2 marks (state average was 58%) </p>
<p>Changeover method</p>
<p class="myanswer">Parallel - while the machine is being proved, leave the employee able to sell tickets at the lolly counter. </p>
<p><em>Note: phased implementation is not possible because there is only one component in the new system. Pilot is an option since it's a chain of cinemas. Direct is quick and cheaper, but is risky. </em></p>
<p>Justification</p>

<p>There are two possibilities: possibly both can be used.</p>
<p class="myanswer">1. On-screen documentation: the machine itself can teach users how to work it.</p>
<p class="myanswer">2. A poster with basic instructions presented really clearly and simply. If anything more than clear and simple documentation is required, it's a sign that the machine's interface is poor. </p>
<p>Justification</p>
<p>Location of documentation</p>
<p class="myanswer">1. On the screen of the machine <em>(derrr!)</em></p>
<p class="myanswer">2. On the wall behind the machine, facing the customer. </p>
<p>Justification</p>
<p class="myanswer">1. Onscreen documentation works best... on the screen.</p>
<p class="myanswer">2. The poster on the wall would be easy to see and would be very accessible - and timely, and relevant. </p>

<p><em>I really like it that the sample response was given for the first issue. If only the examiners did this more often, the frequent arguments about exactly <strong>what a question means</strong> could be put to bed. Well done, examiners. You seem to be learning! </em></p>

<p class="comment"> I was hoping the exams would improve, and they have. I was really in the mood for a good bitch session, but VCAA has done a very reasonable job. The only criticism would be that it was a little too easy. </p>
<p class="comment">There were some good discriminator questions to weed out the A+ students from the A. Most of the questions were reasonably well worded. There was a lot of graphical material for students who are afraid of text (and let's face it: IPM attracted many of them!)</p>
