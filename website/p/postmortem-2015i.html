      <td valign="top" class="examiner"><p>Students were able to design screens for online transactions, taking into account the particular needs described in a given scenario. Responses demonstrated that students were aware of a wide range of layout conventions and design elements. They were able to explain, in brief annotations, how these enhanced the effectiveness (clarity) of communication. </p>
        <p>In <a href="#b5">Question 5</a> annotations were added to screen designs to explain how, for example, the central placement and hierarchy of text helped to establish the identity of the company, encourage users to participate in T-shirt design activities and buy products.<br />
        </p>
        <p>Students demonstrated some understanding of the purpose and process of normalisation. When presented with a flat file data table, most students provided partial solutions consistent with the third normal form (3NF); however, many students did not score any marks for this question.</p>
        <p>          Responses that focused on the specific requirements stated in the question and that provided examples appropriate to the given scenarios were awarded high marks. </p>
        <p>It is worth noting that <strong>questions couched in terms of efficiency or effectiveness require responses that address one or more of the components of these two qualities</strong>. To address efficiency, for example, a response needs to include an example of time, cost or effort. To address effectiveness, a response needs an example of improved accuracy, timeliness, completeness, readability, attractiveness, accessibility, relevance, usability or clarity of message.</p>
        <p>          It was clear that students understood the roles of various procedures and equipment used to protect data and information within security and backup strategies of an information system. However, <a href="#a20">many students confused evaluation with testing</a>.</p>
        <p>      Students drew on their experience with their chosen software application to solve problems. In <a href="/index.html">Question 10</a>, for example, some students created a wide variety of innovative and thoughtful RDBMS and spreadsheet designs to solve the problem of storing and manipulating data shown on a mobile phone screen.</p></td>

        <p class="myanswer">A proxy server is a computer/server that acts as an intermediary between a client and a web resource. The client connects to the proxy server, which then requests a connection, file or other resource on a different server (e.g. a website). An anonymous proxy hides the client's real internet address (IP) from the external resource.</p>
        <p class="comment">Not an easy question to begin with. I'd say many students would be flummoxed by this.</p>

        <p>Sammy Real Estate has offices in 10 suburbs and 15 country towns. Its staff need to send videos of properties and customers&rsquo; financial details between offices.<br />
          The most secure technology for protecting the company&rsquo;s network would be</p>

        </ol>
        <p class="myanswer">Answer is B.</p>
        <p class="myanswer">The only wireless connection that could reach across suburbs and to country towns would be microwave, and that's unfeasibly expensive for a moderate-sized company. Coaxial cable has not been used for networks for a long time. Fibre optic cable is very hard to tap without being noticed, and file encryption would make files unreadable to unauthorised people.</p>
      <p class="myanswer">Still, laying dedicated fibre optic across entire suburbs and into the country is not exactly realistic either. A real solution would be to set up a VPN and use the standard internet infrastructure.</p>

The only way to make one is to create an intermediate 'line' table between two other tables and create 1:many relationships between the 3 tables.</p>
        <p class="myanswer">Tip 3: you'll hardly ever see a one:one relationship either. They are pretty useless.</p>

        <td width="288" valign="top" class="myanswer"><p>- <strong>Incremental</strong> backups are much smaller and quicker than full backups because only new and changed files are saved. By restoring all incremental backups done since the last full backup, the system can be often restored to its state before the data disaster. </p>
          <p>- By saving to the <strong>cloud</strong>, the backups are offsite and immune to whichever disaster destroys the original data.</p>
          <p>- Files usually cannot be opened or copied when they are in use. Doing the backup <strong>at night</strong> will ensure files are closed and can be backed up. Also, doing the backup in 'off peak' time means the backup won't slow down the network as it would do during working hours.</p></td>

<p class="comment">Tip - be sensitive to little parts of the question such as the bit about &quot;<strong>nightly</strong> <strong>incremental</strong> backup to the <strong>cloud</strong>&quot;. Each word has its own implications. Words in exam questions are not added for decoration. Ask yourself why that particular word was added. That's why I used dot points and bolding of key words to make the separate parts of the answer clearer.</p>

<p class="examiner">Responses to this question indicated that students understood the difference between full and incremental backup strategies. Most students gave one reason for the use of a strategy, either in terms of the location and timing or the choice of storage medium. Students who explained each strategy in terms of location, timing and media received high marks. Examples of responses that received marks are shown in the table below.</p>

    ViteHealth is a small shop that sells  vitamin products. Its current website lists products and prices, and provides a  postal address and phone number for customers to place orders. A new manager  has suggested that ViteHealth update its website to include a customer login  and offer online shopping.</p>
  <p>a. Describe <strong>one</strong> advantage to ViteHealth of offering online  shopping. 1 mark [2 lines]</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="myanswer">A broader customer base. Many more customers can now shop from distant locations.</li>
    <li class="myanswer"> Customers enter their own data, saving data processing time for staff and reducing errors in data transcription.</li>
    <li class="myanswer"> Online customers don't wear out the shop's carpet, fill up its parking spaces, shop lift, or require repeated and tedious personal attention by sales staff.  </li>
    </ul>
  <p class="examiner">Responses that identified an advantage of online shopping directly for the ViteHealth business received a mark. Students who described an advantage for the customers of ViteHealth and who then explained the subsequent benefit for ViteHealth also received a mark. Students did not score a mark if they only described an advantage to the customer. Examples of correct answers included:<br />
    &bull; access to a global market leads to increased customers and sales<br />
    &bull; it is easier for a customer to place an order and this leads to increased sales<br />
    &bull; lower overhead costs than a shop, hence a potential increase in profit.</p>
  <p class="examiner">State average: 0.8 / 1</p>
  <p>b. Recommend two techniques that ViteHealth  should use on the updated website to protect the rights of customers supplying  data online. Justify each recommendation.  4 marks</p>

  <p class="examiner">Many students satisfactorily recommended and justified two techniques that ViteHealth should use to protect the rights of customers supplying data online.<br />
    With regard to the security techniques, the majority of responses suggested login and password using HTTPS. Justifications included:<br />
    &bull; the need to secure private financial data from hackers and spyware<br />
    &bull; to prevent bogus customers from placing orders.<br />
    Responses associated with customers&rsquo; rights included:<br />
    &bull; a privacy policy that explains how data will be used<br />
    &bull; a shipping and returns policy that explains delivery procedures and costs along with warranties<br />
    &bull; a means of tracking an order that provides contact details for complaints.<br />
    Most commonly, the justification provided was that the business is required by law to explain why data is collected. Other justifications included:<br />
    &bull; good customer relations leads to a good reputation<br />
    &bull; good data helps to keep the business running efficiently<br />
    &bull; good security stops hackers from destroying the business&rsquo;s reputation.</p>

<p class="comment">This is a bit of a clue that something in their needs must be addressed in the layout convention you nominate. <br />
  Look again at the design brief. It says the  site should:</p>

  <ul>
    <li class="comment">allow international customers  to purchase from the existing range of T-shirts = a control to change the language of the page</li>
    <li class="comment">customers have the option of designing their own T-shirts = How can the layout of the homepage satisfy this?</li>
    <li class="comment"> Once an order  is placed, customers can log in and track their orders = At the top of the page, visitors can either register as new users or for an existing user to login to their account.</li>
    <li class="comment">provide space for contract designers, who work  remotely, to collaborate on the design of new T-shirts = How can the layout of the homepage satisfy this?</li></ul>
<p class="comment">I didn't like this question. <strong>Layout</strong> conventions on the <strong>homepage</strong> won't be relevant to most of the needs stated in the case study. </p>
<p class="comment">Navigation would be relevant - sure. It helps people get to <strong>other</strong> pages to satisfy their needs. </p>
<p class="comment">But <strong>layout</strong> on the homepage? No.</p>
<p class="examiner">Students were asked to explain how the layout convention they annotated in part a. met the needs of Choices@T-shirts. The answer shown below is typical of a response that received full marks. Many other conventions and associated explanations also received marks.<br />
  Convention - Business name text is top and centre of the home page.<br />
  Explanation - 
  The business name gives the website its identity and needs to be at the top and centre of the opening screen so it is the first text seen when the website opens. </p>

    <p align="left">HipDezigns is an online  clothing company targeted at the 20-30-year-old market. Two friends, Kim and  Gerry, regularly access the company&rsquo;s website to check the latest fashions. <br />
      HipDezigns keeps the viewing  history of each user of its website and stores this data to monitor users&rsquo;  interest in particular products. When a user clicks on a product for the third  time, an automatic message is posted next to the product, claiming that there  is only one item left. <br />
      Both Kim  and Gerry were interested in the same product. When they individually went  online at the same time to make their purchase, only Gerry received the  automatic message. Kim, who had visited the website once, did not. </p>

    <p class="myanswer">The company wants to generate sales to improve their profit, but it's unethical to lie to customers about stock levels to stimulate them to buy. </p>
    <p class="myanswer">Whether it's also unethical to store customers' viewing history depends on whether the company has told visitors that it is storing that data, and why.</p>

  &bull; HipDezigns and Kim<br />

      The most frequently stated dilemmas were expressed in terms of HipDezigns&rsquo; relationship with customers; for example: &lsquo;HipDezigns uses deceptive marketing to encourage purchasing and to make a profit when there is no shortage in stock&rsquo; and &lsquo;tracking by number of visits is not illegal but is being used to support an unethical sales practice&rsquo;.</p>

      It's not as if Gerry benefits because she (he?) gets to own the product while Kim does not. Remember that the automated message is a lie. There is no shortage of stock. Kim could easily buy the product too.<br />

      Responses that addressed the effects on Kim included:<br />
      &bull; Positive: not being manipulated into making an impulsive purchase; she is being presented with the actual product information and being treated with respect.<br />
      &bull; Negative: feeling left out when she finds out Gerry is getting special treatment.<br />
      Responses that addressed the effects on Gerry included:<br />
      &bull; Positive: being encouraged to make a decision about buying instead of procrastinating<br />
      &bull; Negative: being manipulated and feeling cheated when he talks to his friend Kim and finds out it was not really the last item.</p>

  <p>c. Explain the importance of using naming conventions in an  RDBMS. Give an example to support your answer.  2 marks [4 lines]</p>
  <p class="myanswer">Names must be meaningful, informative and unambiguous.
    Meaningless names will soon mean nothing and will have to be looked up in a data dictionary to discover what they represent. Poorly chosen names (e.g 'IPSL' for Field4) may also be accidentally used instead of the correct field. Objects may be treated incorrectly, e.g. trying to store decimal places in an integer field.</p>
  <p><span class="myanswer">A name like 'intPaintStockLevel' uses Hungarian Notation ('int') to advertise its defined type, and uses CamelCase to make the words in the name more readable.</span></p>
  <p class="examiner">Most students clearly explained the importance of using naming conventions in an RDBMS. Typically, they stated that it helps users to quickly understand the meaning of data they are reading, or it prevents confusion when users are creating queries within tables or relationships between tables. For example, a field name &lsquo;Paint_Colour&rsquo; gives users a better idea of what the data represents than a fieldname such as &lsquo;Field1&rsquo;. Others described the process of joining two descriptive words, each starting with a capital letter, to create user-friendly field names. Many otherwise correct responses failed to include an example of a user-friendly fieldname or naming convention.</p>

  <p class="examiner">Students were asked to describe how they could use their design to identify the most frequently called number in one month once the data had been developed. Students were required to constrain the call date to the last 28&ndash;31 days and the call type to out. Then they needed to count how many times each call number met both criteria and identify the call number associated with the maximum count. Responses that named reasonable fields, data types, functions and conditions to solve the problem received marks. For example:<br />
    <strong>RDBMS:</strong><br />
    Create a query with conditions on the call date and call type fields CallDate&lt; Now-28 and CallTypeIn=No (out). Count the CallNumbers where the conditions are met. Use the Max or Sort function to list the associated CallNumber.<br />
    <strong>Spreadsheet:</strong><br />
    Create a formula in a new column called CountIfIn=No with a condition on the call date CallDate&lt; Now-28 and CallTypeIn=No. Apply the Max or Sort or Mode function to the range of cells in this column and highlight the associated CallNumber.</p>

  <p align="left" class="comment"><span class="myanswer"><img src="/m/schmacho.jpg" alt="" width="98" height="150" /></span></p>
  <p align="left" class="comment">The stuff in <strong>part a</strong> is <strong>not</strong> a solution: it's just a design for a data dictionary. Are students really meant to evaluate the effectiveness of field types? </p>
  <p align="left" class="comment">Did the examiners actually want students to TEST the effectiveness (accuracy) of the solution's CALCULATIONS in <strong>part b</strong> or <strong>part c</strong>, not EVALUATE the effectiveness of the DATA DICTIONARY in part a?</p>
  <p align="left" class="comment">I just know that some time next year I'm going to be VERY annoyed when the examiner's report comes out. </p>
  <p align="left" class="comment">Dammit. I can't wait until 2016. I'm getting annoyed right now. Here's my answer:</p>
  <p align="left" class="myanswer">Assuming you do actually mean 'evaluate the data dictionary' and not 'test a calculation' <span class="myanswer">and assuming the effectiveness criterion is 'useability' you would refer to the data dictionary's access logs to see how often in the past 3 months database programmers had to look up the  data dictionary to find the purpose or type of a database field.</span> If there are few accesses, the field names appear to have been meaningful and useable.</p>
  <p align="left" class="comment">Sigh. Things were going <strong>so</strong> well up to this dog of a question.</p>
  <p align="left" class="examiner">Students were asked to recommend a strategy to evaluate the effectiveness of their solution. A solution is evaluated after it has been implemented. Many students mistakenly recommended a strategy for testing their solution; that is, during the development stage. Marks were given for responses that stated that the strategy would apply after the solution had been up and running, and that through a survey or a complaints log the accuracy/timeliness/completeness or user-friendliness of records could be checked. Examples included:<br />
    'Track the number of complaints about inaccurate bills over a six-month period'</p>
  <p align="left" class="examiner">'Have an online survey for customers after months. Ask if bills are accurate. Ask if their bill is easy to understand.'</p>

  <td valign="top"><p align="left"><strong>Question 11</strong></p>
    <p align="left">HiSkies is a parachuting club that needs an  online application form for users who want to join the club and learn to  skydive. <br />
      The online form will collect the following data: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>first name  and family name </li>
      <li>date of birth </li>
      <li>mobile  phone number and email address </li>
      <li>a  description of previous skydiving experience (maximum of 100 words) </li>
      <li>acceptance  of club rules </li>
    </ul>
    <p>a. What is the best data type for the field that  collects data on the acceptance of club rules? Explain why. 2 marks  [4 lines]</p>
    <p class="myanswer">Boolean. </p>
    <p class="myanswer">It stores logical true/false answers, which is all that is needed to record acceptance. Also, Boolean data consumes very little storage space, so it is also very economical.</p>
    <p class="comment"><strong>Another</strong> question on data types? Haven't we done it enough in the previous question?</p>
    <p class="examiner">Most students correctly recommended Yes/No (Boolean) as the data type for the field that collects data on the acceptance of club rules, stating that it ensures users can only enter one or the other of two options. A number of students recommended controls such as radio buttons. If they justified this as for a Yes/No (Boolean) data type they received a mark.</p>

    <p>b. Describe an electronic validation technique that  could be used to ensure that a mobile phone number has the correct number of digits. Justify  your answer.  3 marks    </p>
    <p>Electronic validation technique [2 lines]</p>
    <p class="comment">This is shaping up to be another iffy question. The only validation techniques named in the study design are those in Software Development unit 4 -   existence checking, range checking and type checking. No such techniques are named for ITA, except for a mention of 'proofreading' in the PSM discussion on page 17.</p>
    <p class="myanswer">(In Filemaker Pro) Validate the mobile phone number field using a formula, e.g. LENGTH(MobilePhoneNumber)=8. </p>
    <p class="comment">I don't know if MS Access or other RDBMS can do that. </p>
    <p><span class="comment">I only hope the examiners are not expecting students to refer to an <strong>input mask</strong> to force data to fit a pre-defined pattern. I am hoping this because <strong>input masks do not exist in Filemaker Pro or MySQL</strong>, and assuming knowledge of them would be prejudicial against students who used those tools.</span><br />
    </p>
    <p>Justification  [3 lines]</p>
    <p class="myanswer">Using a formula to validate fields in Filemaker is a very flexible way to automate all sorts of complex validation.</p>
    <p class="myanswer">Using an input mask forces users to enter characters in a particular format such as (_ _ _) _ _ _ _-_ _ _ _</p>
    <p class="examiner">Responses that described an input mask or similar designed to accept 10 digits spaced into correct groupings and with an appropriate error message received marks. Justifications included: it gives an error message if the length is wrong, and the spaces make it easy for users to read the number and check it as they enter it. Reponses that suggested restricting the number of digits to 10 also received a mark.</p>
    <p class="examiner">State average - 1.6 / 3</p>
    <p align="left">c. Recommend a testing technique that could be used  to ensure that the form collects the data required. [4 lines]</p>
<p align="left" class="myanswer">Get someone to pretend to be an applicant and ask them to fill in the form several times. On each attempt they would deliberately leave one required field blank. If the database accepted an incomplete form, it would fail testing. </p>
<p align="left" class="myanswer">In one form, the user would also attempt to enter more than 100 words about previous experience. The database should not accept anything after the hundredth word.</p>
<p align="left" class="myanswer">An invalid date should be entered to test whether dates of birth are being appropriately validated.</p>
<p align="left"><span class="myanswer">An attempt should be made to enter an email address without a @ or without at least one dot.</span></p>
<p align="left" class="examiner">Testing strategies that advised the developer to follow three or four appropriate steps generally received full marks. Typically, the steps were:<br />
  &bull; create a table with dummy data and expected results<br />
  &bull; enter the dummy data into the solution and record the actual results<br />
  &bull; check that expected results and actual results are the same and correct any errors.</p>
