      <p> The type of algorithm shown in the pseudocode is a<br />
        <strong>A. </strong>binary search.<br />
        <strong>B. </strong>insertion sort.<br />
        <strong>C. </strong>linear search.<br />
        <strong>D. </strong>quick sort.</p>
      <p class="myanswer">Answer is A.</p>
      <p class="explanation">OK. It's a pretty easy introduction to the exam. The examiners are giving you a freebie: the function in the pseudocode is called &quot;<strong>Search</strong>&quot;</p>
      <p class="explanation">Two of the options are... <strong>sort</strong>. So you can dismiss B and D immediately.</p>
      <p class="explanation">The telltale is<span class="code">(low+high)/2</span>. It is finding the mid-point of the data set, preparing to reject one half of the data, as a binary search does. </p>
      <p class="explanation"><img src="/tip.png" width="40" height="22" alt=""/> Remember that the data needs to be sorted for a binary search to work.</p>
      <p class="explanation">The other option, linear search, works by dumb (but easy to program) brute-force, checking each item in the data set in turn to see if it matches the value being sought. It's the Donald Trump of search algorithms: slow, and simple.</p>
      <p class="comment">Commentary: I haven't done a post-mortem of a SD exam for a few years, and the pseudocode seems to have changed. It used to be extremely simple, plain-English style, but this pseudocode looks very much like Visual BASIC: it identifies itself as a function, it lists its parameters, it returns values. </p>
      <p class="comment">Rather baffling is the &quot;Return -1&quot; near the end. I assume it's meant to signal a failure to find a match, but the intention of the pseudocode is far from obvious - and the entire point of pseudocode is that <em>its intentions must be obvious</em>. </p>
      <p class="comment">&quot;Return <strong>False</strong>&quot; would have been a bit clearer. After all, -1 in most programming languages signifies a logical TRUE, and <strong>zero</strong> is FALSE. </p>

      </p>
      <p> Which one of the following lists of numbers could have been used in this trace?<br />
        <strong>A.</strong> 1, 8, 17, 23, 25, 27<br />
        <strong>B.</strong> 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9<br />

      <p class="comment">This is a tough one.</p>
      <p><span class="myanswer">Answer is D.</span></p>
      <p class="explanation">1. Data must be <strong>sorted </strong>for a binary search to work. That immediately rules out option <strong>C</strong>.</p>
      <p class="explanation">2. Lines numbered 3 tell us we know we need an option containing 17 and 23. That quickly rules out <strong>B</strong>.</p>
      <p class="explanation"><img src="/tip.png" width="40" height="22" alt=""/> Start by eliminating the impossible options, then focus on the remaining candidates. We now only have to look at half of the options.</p>
      <p class="explanation">Mental Note 1 - the <strong>mid</strong> value is apparently an integer, which is why (0+9)/2 gives a <strong>mid</strong> of 4, and not 4.5</p>
      <p class="explanation">Mental Note 2 - the <strong>list[ ]</strong> array must start with index zero - i.e. it has 10 'slots' numbered 0-9. This is crucial when identifying which slot values to look at.</p>
      <p class="explanation">Option A - On the first iteration (look it up - I can't spoon-feed you all of your life) of the WHILE loop in line 3, we compare the target value (25) with list[4] while remembering the array count starts with index 0, so we need to look at the <em>fifth</em> value in the list). Option A's fifth value is... 25. So, that doesn't match the trace table's results</p>
      <p class="explanation">Option D - fifth value in the list is 17. Yay. So far so good, but <strong>don't jump to conclusions</strong>. Follow the rest of the trace to back up your gut feeling. You might have missed something.</p>
      <p class="explanation">Tentatively assume option D is right. Work through the trace table as if that were correct.</p>
      <p class="explanation">The second iteration (did you look it up? I'll be annoyed if you didn't) of the loop compares the target value with 23 - which happens to be list[7]. Bingo. We have confirmed our winner.</p>
      <p class="comment">I had the luxury of unlimited time and an excellent BACKSPACE key to hide my errors. It certainly took me more than 1.2 minutes to work it out.</p>
      <p class="comment">The subtle implications of the zero-based array indexing itself would have tripped up many a student who assumed that the first number in an option was stored in list[1] and not list[0].</p>
      <p class="comment">This question, while fair, would have been pretty damned difficult for nervous young students under exam time constraints. </p>

      <p class="comment">We seem to be leaping from the overly-complicated to the overly-simple questions.</p>
      <p class="explanation">A. Iteration is looping - e.g. WHILE / END WHILE (WEND), DO / LOOP, FOR / NEXT.</p>
      <p class="explanation">B. Selects which lines of code to execute - e.g. IF / ELSE / END IF</p>
      <p class="explanation">C. A method is a <strong>procedure</strong> that can be used on a class of <em>object</em>. e.g. <em>window</em> <strong>close</strong>. <em>text</em> <strong>erase</strong>. <em>dog</em> <strong>scratch his furry face</strong>.</p>
      <p class="explanation">D. A function is a self-contained piece of code that can take incoming values (parameters), calculate a value and return the value to the code that called the function. e.g. square root, convert to uppercase, decide if a year is a leap year or not. </p>

      <p> Within an application&rsquo;s code base, comments can be used to describe the function of particular sections of code and support future maintenance of the application.<br />
        How do programming languages differentiate between the code to be executed and comments that should be ignored?</p>
      <p><strong>A. </strong>Comments are stored in a separate file to the code.<br />
        <strong>B. </strong>Comments are only placed at the very start of the file containing the code.<br />

      <p><strong>A. </strong>a record<br />
        <strong>B. </strong>an array of strings<br />
        <strong>C. </strong>an array of integers<br />
        <strong>D. </strong>an associative array</p>
      <p><span class="myanswer">Answer is B.</span></p>
      <p>A. A record is a set of fields (columns) that make up the data for items (rows). Irrelevant here. A record would be <strong>one</strong> row, not a collection of rows.</p>
      <p>B. Both columns contain alphanumeric (alphabetic and numeric) data, so strings are appropriate. String = text.</p>
      <p>C. Only a few of the fields contain integers, so this can't be it.</p>
      <p>D. An associative array is one where you can you use one unique field (e.g. a person's name) to look up a value associated with that field (e.g. that person's phone number). The duplicated values of &quot;B&quot; and &quot;1&quot; prevent us using this data as a lookup table.</p>

      <p>Logically, it must be B, but the question is, strictly speaking, beyond the scope of the study design.</p>
      <p>If you have read VCAA PSM (Problem Solving Methodology) dogma in the 2020-2024 study design you will know that the Analysis Stage includes the skill of being able to '<em>Identify and clarify the data and information that needs to be collected....</em>'</p>
      <p>So, that is very tempting. But it just says<em> identify and clarify the data that needs to be collected</em>. </p>
      <p>Then it wants you to c<em>ritically analyse the sources of data and information to determine the reliability of it.</em></p>
      <p>What about actually <em>collecting</em> the data? What stage of the PSM includes that?</p>
      <p><img src="/m/doubt.gif" width="35" height="35" alt=""/></p>
      <h2><strong>None.</strong></h2>
      <p>The study design's PSM never says when you <strong>collect</strong> the data. It must be inferred or guessed by students. </p>

      <p class="comment">Either I'm getting way too pedantic in my old age, or this exam is falling apart at the seams. Could go either way...</p>
      <p class="explanation">A log in a report is <strong>not</strong> a 'data collection <em>technique</em>'. It is the <strong>result</strong> of a data collection <em>technique</em> (such as interviews, observation, surveys) which provides the data that are then stored or summarised in a <strong>log</strong>.</p>
      <p class="explanation">The examiners are probably expecting students to choose option <strong>A</strong> because the question said Poh was &quot;checking the customer satisfaction <strong>logs</strong> of the existing system&quot;.</p>
      <p class="explanation">But where did the data in in the logs come from? Interviews? Observation? Surveys? It is impossible to say.The exam certainly doesn't say.</p>
      <p class="explanation">So, start drafting your complaint emails to examinations.vcaa@education.vic.gov.au, and choose what the examiners probably <em>wanted</em> you to say. Option A,</p>

      <p> Considering the information above, which upgrade would be most likely to reduce the time to upload the files to the cloud storage provider?<br />
        <strong>A. </strong>Option 1<br />
        <strong>B. </strong>Option 2<br />
        <strong>C. </strong>Option 3<br />
        <strong>D. </strong>Option 4</p>
      <p><span class="myanswer">Answer is C.</span></p>
      <p class="explanation">A. Even the slowest hard disk on the planet has a data tranfer speed that is FAR faster than an excellent internet upload speed. A typical HDD transfers data at 30-150 Mega<strong>bytes</strong> per second. So, we're talking 240-1200 Mega<strong>bits</strong> per second (Mbps). A good upload speed today is about 40Mbps. Hard disk speed is <em>not</em> a factor in upload slowness.</p>
      <p class="explanation"><img src="/tip.png" width="40" height="22" alt=""/> The unit for data <em>storage</em> is the <strong>byte</strong> (8 bits). The (usual) unit for data <em>transmission</em> is the <strong>bit</strong>. Don't embarrass yourself and your entire family by confusing the two. </p>
      <p class="explanation"><img src="/tip.png" width="40" height="22" alt=""/> Some web browsers annoyingly confuse matters by measuring data transmission speeds in <strong>bytes</strong> per second. They need to be spanked. On the bottom.</p>
      <p class="explanation"><img src="/tip.png" width="40" height="22" alt=""/> 'Byte' is abbreviated to a capital B. 'Bit' is abbreviated as a lowercase b. So - MB = mega<strong>bytes</strong>. Mbps = mega<strong>bits</strong> per second.</p>
      <p class="explanation">B. Once again, the speed of wifi (54Mbps or 1.3Gbps in the question) is FAR faster than the speed offered by an internet service provider. It's like buying a Ferrari in the hope of getting through peak hour traffic more quickly. </p>
      <p class="explanation"><img src="/tip.png" width="40" height="22" alt=""/> <strong>Learn your units. </strong>SD exams will assume you know them.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="explanation">- Mega (M) is about a million. A recorded song needs roughly 10MB. </p>
        <p class="explanation">- a Gigabyte (GB) is about 1024 megabytes. An HD movie takes about 1GB of storage.</p>
        <p class="explanation">- A Terabyte (TB) is about 1024 Gigabytes. Now we're taking about capacities of small hard disks and average SSDs.</p>
        <p class="explanation">- And now we're starting to talk about Petabytes (PB) of storage, A Petabyte is about 1024 Terabytes - or about a million Gigabytes.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Got a million movies to store? You'd need a petabyte of storage and 171 years to watch them all. Good luck with that. </p>
        <p class="explanation"><img src="/tip.png" width="40" height="22" alt=""/> Skip the Adam Sandler movies. You'll thank me in 150 years.</p>
        <p class="explanation">(My first computer in 1978 had 4<strong>KB</strong> of RAM - about 4,000 bytes. My current computer has 32<strong>GB</strong> of RAM - 8,000 times larger.)</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="explanation">C. The upload speed to the internet is the critical factor in this question. Going from 20 to 50 Mbps would certainly improve Moe's upload speed. This is the way.</p>
      <p class="explanation">(<em>This is the way</em>) If you don't watch <em>The Mandalorian</em>, ignore this line and move on.</p>
      <p class="explanation"><img src="/tip.png" width="40" height="22" alt=""/>If you're a keen cloud storage user, find the fastest UPLOAD speed you can amongst available ISPs. You won't regret it. </p>
      <p class="explanation">e.g. Aussie Broadband currently (2023) offers plans with 50/20, 100/20 and 250/25 download/upload rates. Exetel also offers <strong>100/40, </strong>which is great for cloud uploads. Shop around.</p>
      <p class="explanation"><img src="/tip.png" width="40" height="22" alt=""/> Why are ISP <em>download</em> speeds typically much faster than their <em>upload</em> speeds? Because most users download much more than they upload. This <em>asymmetric</em> (unbalanced) speed difference has been around for donkey's years - It's where <strong>A</strong>DSL comes from.. It might change in the future as cloud storage requires faster uploading.</p>
      <p class="explanation">D. Again, RAM size will have little or no effect on upload speeds.</p>

        <strong>C. </strong>become one of the leading toy stores in Australia.<br />

      <p><span class="myanswer">Answer is D. </span></p>

      <p class="explanation">But how can you measure your progress towards such a vague target? You need specific <strong>objectives</strong> that have clear and measurable achievements.e.g. &quot;Being popular&quot; (goal) may be broken down into smaller and specific steps such as:</p>
      <p class="explanation">1. Being in the &quot;XYZ Survey's&quot; top 5 companies or products within 12 months.</p>
      <p class="explanation">2. Outselling competitor X by 10% in Australia within 6 months.</p>
      <p class="explanation"><strong>Objectives</strong> tend to have numbers in them, so they can be measured and be found to have achieved or not.</p>
      <p class="explanation"><strong>Goals</strong> are long-term, vague, and it's nearly impossible to confirm their accomplishment. e.g. &quot;We are proud to announce that we officially became popular at 2:37PM last Tuesday. Yay!&quot;</p>
      <p class="explanation">So - we should look for <em>numbers </em>in the options.</p>
      <p class="explanation"><strong>A</strong> and <strong>C</strong> are <em>goals</em>. Vague, waffly, hard to measure long-term ambitions. Ignore them.</p>
      <p class="explanation"><strong>B</strong> and <strong>D</strong> have a number. That is good, objectively speaking. But which to choose? </p>
      <p class="explanation"><img src="/m/doubt.gif" width="35" height="35" alt=""/></p>
      <p class="explanation"><strong>B</strong> is VERY specific. It measures both quantity and time. That is Good. But does it relate to improving <strong>order tracking</strong>, as the question demands? </p>
      <p class="explanation"><strong>No</strong>. It is about the quantity of sales, which is another matter.</p>
      <p class="explanation"><strong>D</strong> measures the count of complaints about lost orders. It is acceptable as an objective: it is specific and measurable. But most importantly, it relates directly to <strong>order tracking</strong>.</p>

        <strong>D. </strong>associative array</p>
      <p><span class="myanswer">Answer is A.</span></p>
      <p class="explanation">I did not like this question. It was artificial and vague,</p>
      <p class="explanation">We can rule out C because a variable can only be a single value.</p>
      <p class="explanation">Are we to assume that the first line of numbers are the index numbers? Apparently. But this is not made clear.</p>
      <p class="explanation">The second line of numbers <em>could</em> be a record. A record contains a set of fields (values) related to a single entity, such as a person or product. But the fields in a record do <em>not</em> need have to be of a single data type. e.g. an employee record may contain <em>text</em> (surname), <em>date</em> (of birth), and <em>numeric</em> (number of legs) fields.</p>
      <p class="explanation">So, with &quot;single data type&quot; the question seems to be fishing for an <em>array</em>.</p>
      <p class="explanation">That leaves <strong>A</strong> and <strong>D</strong>. </p>
      <p class="explanation">An associative array needs <em>two</em> dimensions - a lookup value and an associated value, e.g. lookup the employee's ID in one field and fetch their surname in another field.</p>
      <p class="explanation">The data provided only has <em>one</em> dimension of data, so there is nothing to associate with.</p>
      <p class="explanation">So, it must be <strong>A</strong>.</p>

      <p> John and Deepa are discussing characteristics of efficient and effective software solutions, in preparation for writing some evaluation criteria.<br />
        Which of the following is a characteristic of an effective software solution?<br />
        <strong>A. </strong>authenticity<br />
        <strong>B. </strong>completeness<br />
        <strong>C. </strong>cost of data processing<br />
        <strong>D. </strong>speed of processing instructions</p>
      <p><span class="myanswer">Answer is B.</span></p>
      <p>Definition time again. Your brain should be buzzing at the word &quot;effective&quot;.</p>
      <p>Rule out <strong>C</strong> (cost) and <strong>D</strong> (speed) because they are efficiency, not effectiveness. OK. We're already halfway there. Easy.</p>
      <p>The sacred VCAA glossary says that: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="red">&quot;Measures of <strong>effectiveness</strong> in a solution include accessibility, accuracy, attractiveness, clarity, communication of message, <strong>completeness</strong>, readability, relevance, timeliness, and usability.&quot;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><em>Completeness</em> is in the list. <em>Authenticity</em> is not. </p>
      <p>(But I think it should be.)</p>
      <p>Don't be misled by SD U4O2 KK06, which doth declare that students shouldst know &quot;characteristics of <strong>data</strong> that has <strong>integrity</strong>, including accuracy, <strong>authenticity</strong>, correctness, reasonableness, relevance and timeliness&quot;</p>
      <p>Good data<strong> integrity</strong> and good <strong>solution effectivenes</strong>s have some overlap, but they are <em>not</em> the same beast.</p>
      <p class="comment">It's a rather boring question based on memorising VCAA's glossary definitions, which is both dull - and debateable.</p>

      <p><span class="myanswer">Answer is D.</span></p>
      <p class="explanation">Rest assured: the examiners were entitled to ask about MITM attacks - it is listed in the KK of SD U4O2 KK03.</p>

        <strong>Establishing expectations for secure development</strong></p>
      <p> Ness wants secure development practices at the forefront of her team&rsquo;s thinking when they are developing the platform. The following secure development practices will be implemented:<br />
        &bull;	two-factor authentication (password and swipe card) to access office spaces and devices working on the project for everyone involved<br />
        &bull;	logs that record user access to office spaces and the development environment, including failed attempts at access<br />
        &bull;	ongoing professional learning about secure development practices<br />
        &bull;	ongoing code auditing for security vulnerabilities<br />
        &bull;	ongoing code auditing to meet industry standards and legal requirements around security.<br />
        These practices will be evaluated for their effectiveness once the project has been completed.<br />
      </p>
      <p>* <strong>Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)</strong> - Application hosted online. Users typically have a subscription to the service and access the application through a web browser, rather than installing the application on their device.<br />
        ** <strong>Translation</strong> - The process of converting written or spoken words from one language into another, while maintaining the meaning of the original text.<br />
        ***<strong> Transcription</strong> &mdash; The process of converting speech or audio into a written or typed text document.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Application development</strong><br />
        <strong>Phase 1: User profile (including authentication) module</strong><br />
        The user profile and authentication procedures are outlined below.</p>
      <p>&bull;	When users sign up to the platform, they provide personal details, including name, email address and billing information (including address). Users are then asked to verify their email address by clicking a link in a confirmation email.<br />
        &bull;	Once verified, users are able to log in using their email address and password combination.<br />
        &bull;	Once authenticated, users can access their user profile and the translation and transcription services offered (when the solution is fully developed).<br />
        A context diagram representing this is shown below.</p>
      <p><img src="/p/2023-sd-post-mortem/cs2.png" width="868" height="278" alt=""/></p>
      <p><br />
        Due to the size of the business, the development team is required under the Privacy Act 1988 to ensure that the personal details of users, and their data, are protected from unauthorised access and misuse.<br />
        Phase 2: Transcription module<br />
        Once the user profile module is completed, an analysis of requirements for the transcription module will be conducted. The team is now working on the design of the transcription module.<br />
        Two alternative designs for the transcription module user interface have been developed.</p>
      <p><img src="/p/2023-sd-post-mortem/cs3.png" width="915" height="423" alt=""/><br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Ness&rsquo;s team has also designed the three evaluation criteria below to use when evaluating the designs for this module.<br />
      </p>

              <strong>Criterion 2</strong>: Design uses standard symbols to communicate functions.<br />
              <strong>Criterion 3</strong>: Design minimises typing to be more efficient across a range of devices.<br /></td>

      <p><strong>Phase 3: Translation module</strong><br />
        Initially the translation module will accept documents in one of five languages (Chinese, English, French, Arabic and Spanish) and be able to translate between languages (for example, English to French, French to English, French to Arabic). It is intended that eventually 50 languages will be supported by the platform. </p>
      <p>Due to a delay in the development of the solution, it has been recommended that a third-party translation service be used to ensure that the platform can be released on time. This third-party service will be accessed by the module, using API (application programming interface) requests/calls.<br />

      <p class="comment">That's all you need to say to get your mark,</p>
      <p class="comment">The Holy Study Design  decrees that <strong>three</strong> models of the problem solving methodology <br>
        (aka SDLC  = <strong>S</strong>oftware <strong>D</strong>evelopment <strong>L</strong>ife <strong>C</strong>ycle) <br>
        be knownst by students: <br>
        (1) agile, (2) spiral and (3) waterfall.</p>
      <p class="comment">Starting with the last, the <strong>waterfall model</strong> starts with analysis, finishes analysis, moves to design, finishes design, starts development (including testing, documentation, implementation) and unto the end of evaluation. Like a waterfall, once you finish a step and go over the edge. You can't go back to a previous stage. It's a one-way path down.</p>
      <p class="comment"><img src="/m/waterfall.png" width="396" height="287" alt=""/></p>
      <p class="comment">The <strong>spiral model</strong> is just a repetitive (iterative) version of the waterfall model. It is the standard procedure for software development: you write software using the Waterfall model, release it as version 1, improve it, release it as version 2, etc. </p>
      <p class="comment">Spiral is just Waterfall with 'rinse and repeat'. </p>
      <p class="comment">The case study description is certainly <em>not</em> Agile.</p>
      <p class="comment">Agile allows developers to return to previous stages of the SDLC before the entire process is finished. e.g. You are halfway through design when you discover that your analysis was incomplete or outdated, so you need to go back and fix the analysis. Or you are busy developing and discover that newly-released technological standards has made your product obsolete so you need to restart design from scratch.      </p>

      <p><br />
        The development of the platform was delayed during the testing of the transcription component of the solution. The business&rsquo;s management insists that Ness must ensure that the new product is released on time. One suggestion is to integrate a third-party Al-based translation service into their platform to help launch the platform on time. Ness&rsquo;s team has identified a particular product that could be integrated into their product; however, she is worried that this approach could present some issues in the medium- and long-term future.<br />
        Propose how Ness and her team could manage each of the following risks that she has identified.</p>
      <p><br />
        Risk 1: Loss of access to the Al-based translation service during server maintenance conducted by the third party.</p>
      <p> Proposal</p>
      <p><br />
        Risk 2: Security vulnerabilities could be introduced into the platform.</p>
      <p> Proposal</p>
      <p> Risk 3: User data could be transferred internationally without their knowledge.</p>

    <td valign="top"><p><strong>Question 14</strong> (4 marks)</p>
      <p> The translation module takes the source document and splits it into paragraphs, resulting in an XML file being generated. The module then sends each paragraph to the API (application programming interface) as separate requests/calls, working through each paragraph node in the file. As each paragraph is translated, the API adds the translated data to the end of the original XML file.</p>
      <p> One of the junior developers recommends using a CSV file to send the data to the API; however, Ness disagrees.</p>
      <p> a.	Justify why it is better to use an XML file in this scenario, rather than a CSV file.	3 marks</p>
      <p>b.	From the options below, circle one factor that would influence the decision to use an XML file when designing the module.	1 mark<br />
