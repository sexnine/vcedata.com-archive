<p><strong>Question 5</strong></p>
<p>Data sent through a cable connection is naturally more secure than data sent through a wireless connection. This statement is</p>
<p><strong>A.&nbsp;true, because to dishonestly obtain data from a cable requires a physical connection to be made to the<br />
cable.</strong></p>
<p>B.&nbsp;false, because wireless transmissions are encrypted and so data is safe from unauthorised access.</p>
<p>C.&nbsp;true, because when wireless is used, data is broadcast to all computers within a 10-kilometre radius of the<br />
transmitter.</p>
<p>D.&nbsp;false, because cable connections can only go a certain distance before wireless has to be used.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Answer is A. Cable must be physically tapped to steal signal. Wireless cannot be geographically constrained and can be received remotely.</p>
<p class="myanswer"><em>Interesting question. It can't be B because not all wireless is encrypted, and encryption is not always uncrackable. It can't be C because wireless does not often reach 10km. It can't be D because some cables can outstretch wireless (e.g. fibre optic).</em></p>

They just can't be understood by the very literally-minded compiler. Logic errors occur when language rules are not broken, but the result is not what you expected.

<p><strong>Question 19</strong></p>
<p>A program reads a set of money amounts entered via a keyboard. It stores each amount into a file in the order it is received. This file is later accessed by reading the data in the order it was received. This kind of file access is known as</p>
<p>A.&nbsp;normal access.</p>

<p>C.&nbsp;random access.</p>
<p><strong>D.&nbsp;serial access.</strong></p>
<p class="myanswer">Answer is D. </p>
<p class="comment">I've often wondered if there is a difference between serial access and sequential access, but in this case it's not important. There's only one viable option. One text tells me that sequential files are sorted by one or more fields. Serial access records appear in the order in which they were entered. In both cases, they are different to random access files in which records can be accessed without having to read all of the records between where the read/write head is and where the record is stored. Hard disks, CDs, DVDs, even old LP vinyl record players are random: the head can be lifted and dropped anywhere, instantly. Serial/sequential files are more akin to cassette tape which must be rewound or fast forwarded to find a particular song.</p>

<p><strong>Question 1</strong></p>
<p>Two important file management procedures are 'archiving' and 'backing up'. Both involve copying files, but they have very different purposes, </p>
<p>a.&nbsp;State the main purpose of each procedure. </p>
<p>Main purpose of archiving</p>
<p class="myanswer">Instead of deleting files that are no longer required, they are taken offline and stored elsewhere to free up storage space. </p>
<p>Main purpose of backup</p>
<p class="myanswer">To protect files by copying them to a second location.</p>
<p>2 marks - State average was 1.5.</p>
<p class="examiner">Acceptable purposes included:<br />
&bull; archiving: long-term storage of main system files in case information is needed in the future and to free up space on the main system<br />
&bull; backup: storage of files so that the system can be restored in the case of a crash or similar problem &ndash; data security.<br />
This question asked students to state the purpose of archiving and backup and did not ask for an explanation of how to do it. A large number of students did not appear to know the purpose of archiving, even though it is listed in the VCE Software Development Study Design. Students needed to explain why the process was used, not how the process was performed. Many students explained how to archive and/or backup and therefore did not answer the question.</p>
<p>Describe one difference between them.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Files that are archived are deleted from the original location. Backed up files are copied, not moved, and the original copy remains in place.</p>
<p>2 marks - Average 1.1</p>
<p class="examiner">A possible response could have been:<br />
<em>Archiving is the storage of important data that is external to the main system for the purpose of later retrieval if required. Backup is the storage of data that is external to the main system in case the system crashes and data is lost. </em></p>
<p class="examiner">This question required students to explain a difference between archiving and backup. Many students struggled to describe a difference and simply gave a definition without contrasting one process with the other. Many students also tended to repeat their answer for part a. Archiving transfers inactive files to an auxiliary storage medium before being deleted from the hard disk. Backups involve the copying of active files to an auxiliary storage medium to safeguard against loss or corruption &ndash; the files are not deleted.</p>

<p class="myanswer">User documentation provides software users with information on how to use the software. Internal documentation (such as comments within a program) is not seen by users; it is meant to tell programmers important things about the code, such as: what it does; why it was written as it was; who wrote it; its version; warnings to future developers etc.</p>

<p class="examiner">&bull; user documentation explains the use and features of a program as well as providing a guide to fix any common errors. It is external and usually printed in hard copy through online user documentation<br />
&bull; internal documentation refers to the comments inserted into the code by the original programmers. These comments provide guidance or explanations to maintenance programmers who may have to fix bugs in the software<br />

<p><strong>Question 3</strong></p>
<p>List the main features of a naming convention for variables and procedures that you have used in your programming this year. State two advantages of this convention.</p>
<p>Main features</p>
<p class="myanswer">'Hungarian notation' uses a <strong>prefix.name</strong> format such as txtFirstName, boolMarried, globalFlag.The prefix identifies the object type, and the name instantiates an particular instance of the object. </p>
<p>Advantage 1</p>
<p class="myanswer">The prefix clearly identifies the type of the object so mismatched objects cannot be accidentally combined. e.g. if bNumber is a a byte variable (which can hold up to 255) and pPoint is a 32 bit pointer, the programmer would quickly realise that bNumber = pPoint + 1 would lead to an error because any 'p' variable could never fit into a 'b' variable.</p>
<p>Advantage 2</p>
<p class="myanswer">It promotes consistency throughout a program, and throughout a team. It reduces the chances that an individual or team mate will mistreat variables because they did not realise their type. It's also more efficient for program maintenance, since returning to work on a program after a long absence will be easier because the programmer will not need to relearn that particular program's naming scheme.</p>
<p>3 marks - average 1.6</p>
<p class="examiner">Students were asked to describe the features of a naming convention and state the advantages of this convention. Students needed to give two different advantages and not simply a rewrite of one advantage. It was disappointing to see the number of students who did not answer this question.</p>
<p class="examiner">Following is an example of a student response that does not use Hungarian notation.<br />
<em>Main features: clear naming &ndash; relating the variable/procedure name to its purpose and using an underscore to separate multiple words, that is, 'procedure name'.<br />
Advantage 1: makes it easier to tell what the purpose of the variable or procedure is if someone else was to read the program.<br />
Advantage 2: the use of underscore makes the variable name easy to read and therefore easier to understand.</em></p>

<p><strong>Question 4</strong> </p>
<p>A program is being written that will require a file to be randomly accessed many times in order to read data from it. The file contains about 600 megabytes of data and is currently stored on a CD. The programmer has three options.</p>
<p>A - Write the program so that it reads the data as needed directly from the CD.</p>
<p>B - Write the program so that it first copies the entire file onto hard disk and then reads the data as needed.</p>
<p>C - Write the program so that it first copies the entire file into main memory and then reads the data as needed.</p>
<p>Which option should the programmer choose in order to minimise the program's running time? Give reasons for your answer.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Option C. RAM access is far faster than accessing hard disks, and especially optical media.</p>
<p class="comment">The key information in the question was <strong>&quot;minimise running time&quot;</strong>. There would be arguments for using the other options under different circumstances, but not if the main aim was speed. The instruction was to give <strong>reasons</strong> (plural) but I can't really think of a second one. Perhaps explain that (1) seeking and (2) reading/writing operations would be faster in RAM than either of the options.</p>
<p>2 marks - average 1.0</p>
<p class="examiner">C &minus; Write the program so that it first copies the entire file into main memory and then reads the data as needed.<br />
<br />
C was the expected answer due to the speed of access and the critical words in the question 'randomly accessed many times'. However, many students chose option B 'Write the program so that it first copies the entire file onto hard disk and then reads the data as needed', arguing that the memory may not be able to handle 600 Mb of data without slowing the computer down which was also accepted. Students were expected to give reasons why the non-selected systems were inferior. Many students did not discuss the options they did not choose.</p>

<h1 align="center"><a name="cs"></a><strong>Pattie's Parties</strong></h1>
<p>Pattie owns a small business: Pattie's Parties. It is a party planning and catering service that Pattie runs from her suburban home. Pattie advertises through the Yellow Pages and a simple website. She also has a team of event coordinators: people who she can hire on a casual basis to coordinate the event on the day.</p>
<p>When first planning an event, Pattie visits the home of a client and writes down information about their event. When she returns home she enters the information into a 'quotes' spreadsheet. The spreadsheet calculates the item costs and gives a total. Pattie enters this data into a word processor so a properly formatted quote and covering letter can be printed. The letter and quote are then sent either by post or email to the client.</p>
<p>If the quote is accepted, Pattie arranges the event including</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;booking a venue</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;ordering the catering and equipment for the event</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;organising security if required</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;selecting an event coordinator from her team.</p>
<p>Pattie keeps information about suppliers and products in a 'suppliers' spreadsheet. It is linked to the quotes spreadsheet so that quotes have up-to-date prices and product numbers. In the past, she updated the suppliers spreadsheet as soon as her suppliers provided her with new information.</p>
<p><strong>The problem</strong></p>
<p>Pattie's Parties has been so successful that a year ago Pattie had to hire two people to help her do the quote preparation and event arrangement work. So that her workers can also work from home, Pattie sends them a new version of her suppliers spreadsheet as soon as she updates it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the continued increase in business, and having two staff to work with, has led to the following difficulties.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Long delays in preparing and sending out an up-to-date suppliers spreadsheet. This has resulted in a loss of income for Pattie's Parties either because the new job is underquoted (out-of-date data), or because the job is lost (the client is not prepared to wait).</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Occasional double-booking of event coordinators and some specialist equipment, because the three people organising events are not fully aware of all other events.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed system</strong></p>
<p>Lucy, a systems analyst who Pattie hired to look into her business difficulties, has suggested the following.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Pattie's Parties set up a central database that includes information about suppliers, products, staffing and client bookings. The supplier and product information should be kept up to date by electronic transfer of information between the suppliers and Pattie's Parties.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;The central database be hosted by an ISP.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Pattie and her staff are each issued with a mobile computing device that allows the user to</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;use information obtained from the central database</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;show the-client images (stills and video clips) of products and past parties so that the client can make decisions more easily</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;enter all party requirements and a detailed description of the party venue</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;print a quote to give to the client before leaving the client's home</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;upload bookings into the central database</p>
<p>&bull;&nbsp;perform all other activities related to the business.</p>

<p>Lucy advises that purpose-built software is the best way to go and provides Pattie with specifications. Pattie hires the company Baron Software to write the software for the new system.</p>
<p><strong>Question 5</strong></p>
<p>The software specifications show that a procedure is required to enable Pattie to see which event coordinators are available on a particular date. The algorithm for this procedure has been created and is shown below.</p>
<p>The algorithm uses the following variables.</p>

<p>a.&nbsp;Using the test data above</p>
<p>i.&nbsp;What output would you expect to get if the algorithm was correct? </p>
<p class="myanswer">Pattie</p>
<p class="myanswer">Manfred</p>
<p>ii.&nbsp;What output does the algorithm actually give?</p>
<p class="myanswer">Charles</p>
<p>2 marks - average 0.3</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;Describe the error in the algorithm.</p>
<p class="myanswer">It sets the count_coordinator to 1 during initialisation and does it again as soon as the outside REPEAT begins, so the starting count is 1 higher than it should be. <br />
Therefore only the first two coordinators are tested, and it sets the wrong coordinator's availability flag.</p>
<p>2 marks - average 0.5</p>
<p class="examiner">The Count_Coordinator was initialised at 1 and then immediately increased to 2 before the first coordinator&rsquo;s details were accessed. Therefore, the first coordinator&rsquo;s details were allocated to the second coordinator, and the second to the third, without the third ever being accessed. Many students recognised this error even if they could not complete part a.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;Suggest one way the algorithm could be altered to fix this error.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Change the initialisation to Count_coordinators = 0</p>
<p>or (not as easily)...</p>
<p class="myanswer">Move the count increment to just before the UNTIL count_coordinator = num_coordinators, and change the '=' to '&gt;'</p>
<p>2 marks - average 0.5</p>
<p class="examiner">To fix the error initialise the Count_Coordinator to 0 instead of 1. <br />
An alternative patch would be to move the line &#129;'Count_Coordinator &#129;&lt;-- Count Coordinator + 1' to just before the line &#129;'UNTIL Count_Coordinator = Num_Coordinators&#129;'.<br />
If the second method was chosen, students needed to alter the UNTIL line by changing the &#129;'=&#129;' sign to a &#129;'&gt;&#129;' sign or changing Num_Coordinators to Num_Coordinators + 1. <br />
Students who answered Question 5b. correctly generally also answered this question correctly. However, students who chose the second method of fixing the error generally did not mention the change to the UNTIL line and only obtained half marks.</p>
<p class="examiner">This question was presented in two parts. The first part required students to read the test data and the description of what was wanted and predict what the algorithm should have produced. <br />
The second part of the question required students to desk check the algorithm to find out what was produced. <br />
In responses where this was done well, the answers to parts b and c of the question were also done well. <br />
Students should be able to create expected results from test data and also desk check algorithms, although most did not do so. <br />

<p class="comment">A pet peeve of mine, which I really find irksome is that the examiners use a left-facing arrow in their pseudocode to represent assignment. It's a royal pain to type into a webpage! The best I can manage is using Wingdings font (a pain) or using a potentially ambiguous substitute such as &lt;= or &lt;-- (which never look right). What's so difficult with using = or even == (two equal signs) to indicate assignment of values? They're commonly used in most languages!</p>

<p><strong>Question 8</strong></p>
<p>Part of Pattie's agreement with Baron Software is to keep development costs to a minimum. When the programmers are discussing how best to store the client quotes on the mobile device, one programmer, Schroeder, argues that they must include encryption. Another programmer, Sally, disagrees as encryption will increase the overall development cost.</p>
<p>Discuss the ethical considerations from each point of view.</p>
<p class="myanswer"><strong>Including</strong> encryption is ethical since it would protect clients' personal information. It's not that Pattie's organisation would likely be subject to the Privacy Act, but any organisation should take reasonable steps to protect clients' data, especially if it's being stored/transmitted in potentially risky environments such as wireless communications.</p>
<p class="myanswer"><strong>Excluding</strong> encryption would be ethical in that they have an obligation to keep the costs down for the benefit of the client.</p>
<p class="myanswer"><em>(It seems this question was written by a Peanuts comic fan!)</em></p>
<p>4 marks - average 2.2</p>
<p class="examiner">Generally this question was not answered as well as expected. Students were asked to discuss the ethical considerations from both points of view. It was expected that students would contrast the two views and add further relevant information showing their understanding. However, many failed to do this and either simply restated the question and/or only discussed one point of view. Students need more practice on this type of question. Students need to understand that when an ethical dilemma exists usually there is not a clear-cut right or wrong viewpoint; rather it is a matter of weighing up these viewpoints, and determining which stakeholder has the strongest argument.<br />
The following is an example of a reasonable answer. <br />
<em>Ethically programmers are expected to create programs which do not maliciously seek to cause harm to other companies (i.e. virus) and are expected to maintain the integrity of the data which has been given to them, so as it does not breach the Privacy Act 1988 or the Information Privacy Act 2000. While Sally contends that implementing encryption software is expensive and will increase the overall development costs, and it might be ethically wrong, she is bound by law to abide with the agreement with Pattie. While Schroeder is correct that ethically they should include the encryption software as it is part of their job as programmers to protect the information given to them, legally he cannot do anything about it as he would be breaking the contractual agreement which Pattie agreed to.</em></p>

<p>3. <span class="myanswer">Linus</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>b. Explanation for the order of your choice</p>
<p class="myanswer">The specifications are quite similar, so it comes down to details. </p>
<p class="myanswer">The main reason for the <strong>Marcell</strong> is its input facilities: it's the only one with a full keyboard and styles to make it quicker and easier to enter data. Its screen is reasonably-sized to comfortably show pictures and video to clients. Its RAM, HDD, USB, battery life and DVD are no worse than the <strong>Franklin</strong>, and better than the <strong>Linus</strong> (which has a smaller HDD and screen). The <strong>Marcell</strong> also has a RJ45 for the CAT cable, which may be a bonus back at the office to speed up data communications. One feature lacking in the <strong>Marcell</strong> is that it's the only one without a camera, but the device was never said to need to take pictures, only to show them, so this factor can be discounted.</p>
<p class="myanswer">The second choice, <strong>Franklin</strong> is equal to the <strong>Marcell</strong> in nearly every respect except for the keyboard. It shares the <strong>Marcell's</strong> screen and HDD benefits over the remaining option, the <strong>Linus</strong>. The bar code scanner is unique, but is not useful to Pattie.</p>
<p class="myanswer">The Linus' only score comes from equal-best battery life, but on the other hand it has one less USB port than the other devices.</p>
<p>4 marks - average 2.8</p>
<p class="examiner">This question was generally well answered. Students who answered it poorly did not take into account the reason for the use of the mobile computing device and instead chose the largest and best model. <br />
The following is a sample of a good discussion. <br />
<em>The Marcell and Franklin models have large hard drives for image and video storage, as well as for software, whereas the Linus does not. The Linus&rsquo; screen is too small to view images or video and although the Franklin&rsquo;s screen is larger, the Marcell&rsquo;s screen is big enough. The battery life and the input does not differ greatly between the three models. The full keyboard will be useful for the detailed description of parties, but the camera and barcode scanner are not needed. The Marcell does the required job the best.</em></p>
<p class="comment">I'm a bit confused. Wireless LAN (i.e. 802.11) is not going to give them internet access unless every client has a WLAN that they can connect to. They would need to have broadband wireless - WAN wireless, not LAN wireless. That's unless they have a USB-connected broadband wireless modem. So, strictly speaking none of the options is acceptable without adding equipment to them. Question 10 follows this up...</p>

<p>Later, Pattie receives this junk mail advertising. She realises that if this is true, then her staff could connect to the website and upload the accepted quotes immediately from the client's home. But she would need to ask the company for more information about its offer.</p>
<p class="comment">If she has only <strong>now</strong> discovered this possiblity, she must have been intending to only connect to the website when at the office. After Question 4 asked whether it was better to work offline (system A) or online (system B), I assumed she was aware of this possibility and would naturally have gone for the online alternative. Apparently she didn't, which is an odd decision. Either that, or she didn't know that broadband internet existed, which is even stranger for a so-called system analyst.</p>

&bull; high-speed wireless network <br />

<p>In order to implement the new system, Pattie needs to provide her staff with appropriate training and user documentation to support them in its use.</p>
<p><strong>Question 12</strong></p>
<p>Baron Software has a room on its premises for training clients. It contains a set of networked desktop computers which can be loaded with the client's software. Baron Software has offered Pattie two training programs.</p>
<p>1&nbsp;One day at Baron premises for Pattie and her staff at a total cost of $300</p>
<p>2&nbsp;A half-day at Pattie's house and then at the home of each staff member at a total cost of $600 </p>
<p>a.&nbsp;State one advantage, apart from cost, of each training program.</p>
<p>Advantage of training program 1</p>
<p class="myanswer">It's cheaper than the other option.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Pattie does not need to buy hardware and set up mobile internet accounts before training begins.</p>
<p class="myanswer">One would trust Baron to set up the software properly so it reflects how Pattie wil be using it for real.</p>
<p>Advantage of training program 2</p>
<p class="myanswer">It's individualised one-on-one nature means that the instructor can focus on the specific needs of each trainee.</p>
<p class="myanswer">It's more convenient not having to travel to be trained.</p>
<p class="myanswer">It can be set up in the same sort of environment in which it will be used for real, so the training is more realistic and can reveal potential implementation issues.</p>
<p>2 marks - average 1.5</p>
<p class="examiner">&bull; Advantage of Training program 1: the staff can concentrate on learning Pattie&rsquo;s new system and not be distracted by the day-to-day business. <br />
&bull; Advantage of Training program 2: staff would learn to use the new system on the job and can apply what they are learning to real life situations. It also gives them the opportunity to ensure the system will work correctly from each home.<br />
This question was well answered. For the minority of students who did not score full marks, it was because they cited cost as an advantage (when the question asked them to state an advantage apart from cost) or claimed that they would not get professional trainers for option 2, despite the question stating that the same company was supplying the training. Students also lacked knowledge of what onsite training involves.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;Considering all factors, recommend which option would be better for Pattie's business and explain your choice.</p>
<p>Recommendation</p>
<p class="myanswer">Program 2. While it is more expensive, it is money wisely spent. Personal training will better address the individual needs of each person's level of skill and preferred learning style.
It is likely to be more effective and also more efficient because training time is not being wasted explaining things to people who already understand them, or inadequately explaining things to some people and not others. Since it's vital that the users can use the system properly, second-rate training could leave them underequipped for the tasks they will need to perform; they could even damage the system if they use it without fully understanding how it works.</p>
<p>1 mark - average 0.8</p>
<p class="examiner">Pattie should choose option two despite the cost as this training allows the staff to see how the new system will actually work from Pattie&rsquo;s house. Pattie&rsquo;s staff will learn how their mobile devices and the new software will work from their homes. <br />
This question was well answered. Most students were able to find justifications for the option they chose.</p>

Using the headings below, outline a strategy Pattie could use to determine whether this system goal has been met after implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation strategy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="myanswer">Time how long it takes to create a range of quotes and compare those times with times taken before the system was implemented.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Compare actual costs with quotes and see whether they are more or less accurate than the previous system.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Count the number of times errors such as double-bookings or incorrect prices occurred compared to the old system.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Count the number of times quotes could be delivered to the client onsite rather than at a later time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Time frame</strong></p>
<p class="myanswer">Evaluation should begin a reasonable time after the system has been implemented fully, but not so long that they have completely forgotten about the old system's strengths and weaknesses. If the system is used daily, perhaps one month of usage might be adequate. It is important that users have had enough time to become well-acquainted with the system so they can use it skilfully and confidently and assess its performance knowledgably.</p>
<p><strong>Data to be collected and from where</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class="myanswer">Collect timings of how long it took to generate quotes from a log book maintained by each user.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Refer to copies of quotes generated with the new system and compare them with actual costs.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Users should have been instructed to record any instances of double-bookings or bad prices occurring. Refer to these records to get a system failure rate.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Use copies of quotes to see if the date and time the quote was generated was more than a day after the client meeting.</li>
</ul>
<p class="comment">Note that other techniques such as interviews and surveys are not really appropriate for objective assessments of times and financial accuracy. They should be reserved for subjective criteria such as ease of use, comfort levels, attractiveness etc, which are very human factors that are hard or impossible to measure scientifically. </p>
<p><strong>How the data will be used to evaluate this system goal</strong></p>
<p class="myanswer">If the data reveals that the system produced quotes that accurately predicted actual party costs, and also were produced quickly, the system goal could be said to have been achieved. If not, remedial action might be needed to enhance the system.</p>
<p>1 +2 + 2 = 5 marks - average 1.8</p>
<p class="examiner">This question was poorly answered with very few students getting full marks. Many students did not understand what an evaluation strategy is and what it should include. Many students also did not refer to the criteria that were to be evaluated and their answers were not relevant. The following is a sample answer. <br />
<em>Time frame: three to six months after the implementation of the new system.<br />
Data to be collected and from where: database (to collect initial quotes and final billing details). Get feedback from customers regarding the timeliness of the quote.<br />
How the data will be used to evaluate this system goal: if the initial quote and final billing details are usually close, this would indicate that Pattie had achieved her goal of providing accurate quotes. If the customers responded positively about the timeliness of the quote, this would mean that Pattie had achieved her goal of providing timely quotes</em>.</p>
