      <p align="center" class="examiner"><strong>EXAMINERS' GENERAL COMMENTS (paraphrased by me) </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li class="examiner"> Some students rewrote the question before starting their response, which was not necessary. </li>
        <li class="examiner"> Weaker students did not pay careful attention to the stem of the question and responded in a generic manner - especially 
          Q11d, 12b and 13c. e.g. in 12B 
          students tended to <em>list</em> rather than explain, e.g. &lsquo;Training should be on-site&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;I would recommend that the training occur at the library so staff are in a familiar environment&rsquo; </li>
        <li class="examiner"> Students should be familiar with terms such as list, outline, explain, discuss and justify. A useful strategy is to highlight key words. </li>
        <li class="examiner">Weaker students stood out in questions that required multiple responses, for example Questions 1b, 2b, 7, 10c and 13e. Some students only answered one requirement; others answered both requirements by just repeating the same response using slightly different wording. For example, for Question 13e, a common student response was &lsquo;Difficulty one is that staff cannot easily find a client&rsquo;s quote&rsquo; and &lsquo;Difficulty two is that when a client rings up with a query it is hard to find their quote&rsquo;. </li>
        <li><span class="examiner">Students should indicate their understanding of key study terms when using them in responses, e.g. don't use the words &lsquo;efficiency&rsquo; and &lsquo;effectiveness&rsquo; without showing an understanding of those words. e.g. In Question 1b just saying a drop down box &lsquo;is more efficient&rsquo; and &lsquo;is more effective&rsquo; <strong>does not earn marks</strong>. </span><br />

      <p class="comment">O dear o dear. Not a good start for the 2004 exam. It sure isn't &lt;A&gt; (the star is way wrong), and in &lt;B&gt; the star looks more like a Hebrew topology. Can't be &lt;D&gt; because there's nothing at the hub of the star. That can only leave <strong>&lt;C*&gt; </strong>but... What am I going to say, kiddies? Yes! </p>

      <p><strong><img src= "/m/pm/breakfast.jpg" alt="" width="81" height="79" /></strong></p>
      <p class="comment">Other people have commented on the minuscule nature of the pictures, including the sardonic observation that students were required to have pencils and pens, but not magnifying glasses. One of my students reported he had trouble seeing whether the thing was a computer or a switch - or perhaps a Dog's Breakfast &#8482;?</p>
      <p class="comment">One contributor suggested: </p>
      <p class="comment"><em>If the network design is considered as the logical design and not the physical design then the diagram is probably correct. </em></p>
      <p class="comment">But one wonders why the bus logical design would include something as trivial as terminators, while the star omits a core piece of equipment like a switch. All I know is that showing kids designs like that encourages them to present physical designs just like that - with no switch.</p>

      <p class="myanswer">Hmmm. I've never heard of &lt;D&gt; organisational decisions. Cross it out. <br />
        It surely can't be &lt;B&gt; strategic, which would be a long-term and big decision. Zap that. <br />
        The only real options are &lt;A*&gt; tactical and &lt;C&gt; operational. </p>

        <em>Operational</em> decisions are day-to-day or week-to-week decisions to keep the organisation operating and working.</p>

      <p class="comment"><strong>Editorial</strong>: Do the examiners have trouble putting dependency arrows on their Gantt charts? It would really help students read charts if it were clear which tasks were dependent on which others. The dependencies are indicated in the names of tasks (e.g. &quot;install XXX <em>after </em>YYY is done&quot;) 
        which is satisfactory, but rather awkward. Why leave the dependency arrows out? Because they're hard to draw if using Excel to create the chart? Dependency arrows exist in Gantt charts for a Very Good Reason, and I think it would be nice if the examiners used them. </p>

      <p class="myanswer">OK. Deep breath... Think...<br />
        Only tasks that are NOT on the critical path can <em>possibly</em> run over time without affecting the completion date, so eliminate the 4 tasks on the critical path (1,2,4,5).<br />
        This leaves 2 tasks (3,6), so the the answer <em>must</em> be 1 or 2 tasks.</p>

      <p class="myanswer">This is a bit of a complex one, requiring a deep breath and careful attention to the options. </p>
      <p class="myanswer">Two options (A and B) can be eliminated immediately because you would need to restore the Friday full backup <em>before </em>adding on the incremental backups from Mon and Tues. Otherwise you could be overwriting newer files with older ones.</p>
      <p class="myanswer">So, what's the difference betwen the remaining options, &lt;C&gt; and &lt;D&gt;? <br />
        Should you remove damaged files <em>before </em>or <em>after </em>updating virus software? <br />
        It's not a hard question when you calmly think about it a little. </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="myanswer">How are you going to tell which files are infected and need to be removed? <em>Use a virus scanner. </em></li>
        <li class="myanswer">Will the currrent virus definitions be able to find the virus in infected files? <em>No, because they let the virus in earlier. The virus must have been released after the virus definitions were released.</em></li>
        <li class="myanswer">What do you need to do to find the infected files? <em>Update the virus definitions.</em></li>
        <li class="myanswer">Now the virus scanner can detect the virus, identify the infected files, and remove or clean them.</li>

      <p class="comment"><strong>Preferred conventions</strong> dictate the way that <em>most</em> people <em>really strongly</em> prefer things to be done. Having the $ to show the units in the prices column <strong>(item D)</strong> is an example.</p>
      <p class="comment"><strong>Optional conventions</strong> are those presentation decisions where you have freedom choice. While the ATO requires the &quot;Coles Supermarkets Australia Pty Ltd&quot; line, the decision to have the graphic COLES logo and slogan <strong>(item B)</strong> is a choice of the supermarket. Also optional is having the weight and cost per kg of the tomatoes <strong>(item E)</strong>- some shops would just list &quot;tomatoes&quot; and the price.</p>
      <p class="comment">Note: the dividing line between &quot;optional&quot; and &quot;preferable&quot; is as variable as Britney Spears' marital status. You can sometimes successfully argue for one or the other. It's a shame one can't justify choices in the multiple choice section of the exam... some of them REALLY need arguing! </p>

          <p><em>Excerpts from The Age, Next, p5, Tuesday 14 October 2003 </em></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p>a. Why should a backup or recovery plan be tested? (3 lines, 1 mark, <strong>SM=0.6</strong>) </p>
      <p class="myanswer">If you back up and never test that the data can be restored, the time you finally really <em>need</em> to recover lost data, it may not be possible. e.g. the wrong data may have been backed up, the backup media are faulty, or the backup software cannot read its own backups. </p>
      <p>b. Explain why a hot site is located in 'an anonymous building' and 'away from the city centre'. (8 lines, 2 marks, <strong>SM=1.1</strong>) </p>
      <p class="myanswer">To prevent attack or theft of valuable and sensitive data. City centres may more likely to be subject to large fires, riots etc. </p>
      <p>c. Outline <strong>two </strong> reasons why tapes are recommended backup media. (2x4 lines, 2 marks, <strong>SM=1.35</strong>) </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="myanswer">They can hold very large quantities of data (e.g. 20-80GB) at a low cost per gigabyte</li>
        <li class="myanswer">Quarter-inch cartridges (QIC) DAT tapes are physically small and take little storage space</li>
        <li class="myanswer">Tapes are very reliable - far moreso than floppy disks</li>
        <li class="myanswer">They are industry-standard and well-supported by hardware and software manufacturers</li>
        <li class="myanswer">Tapes can be purchased easily </li>
      </ul>
      <p>d. A large company which operates six days a week from 7.00 am to 7.00 pm completes a full backup every Saturday night after closing. An incremental backup is completed at midday on Tuesday and Thursday. Tapes are stored on site in a fireproof safe. Would you consider this to be a 'strict backup regime'? Justify your answer. (11 lines, 3 marks, <strong>SM=1.45</strong>) </p>
      <p class="myanswer">It's a flawed backup regime.</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="myanswer">Doing the full weekly backup is good, and doing it after hours is a good idea.</li>
        <li class="myanswer">Incremental backups on only two days a week is a failing because data can easily be lost from days that are not backed up (Monday, Wednesday, Friday). </li>
        <li class="myanswer">Doing the incremental backups at midday is a bad idea. The backup will slow down the network, and any files that are in use will not be backed up because of file locking.</li>
        <li class="myanswer">While a fireproof safe is better than a desk drawer, backup tapes should be stored off-site. </li>

      <p> <span class="comment"><em>Big banks now have their data warehouses located at least 20 kilometres outside the metropolitan areas ... </em></span></p>
      <p class="comment">Does this have <em>anything</em> to do with testing their backups, as foreshadowed in the previous sentence? And what <em>are</em> data warehouses, exactly? Do they store backup tapes? Servers? What?</p>
      <p class="comment"><em>Hewlett-Packard operates 44 data recovery centres worldwide, including two in Sydney. Known as hot sites, they are housed in anonymous buildings, in undisclosed, locations, away from city centres ... </em></p>
      <p class="comment">What do these data recovery centres <em>do</em>? This is where I have real problems with this article - <strong>it simply does not say what these centres are for!</strong> Do they recover data lost on servers' hard disks? Do they pull DAT tapes apart and recover data from them? Do client companies use these centres to store the backup tapes they generate? Do companies back up their data directly to these remote HP data centres? Give me a clue... please!</p>
      <p class="comment"><em>They depend on clients maintaining a strict data backup regime, with tapes produced at regular intervals and stored away from their data centre.</em></p>
      <p class="comment">&quot;They&quot; refers to HP - keep that in mind: it's important later. So HP depends on clients doing good backups - why? What does HP have to do with their clients' backups? The article does not say. </p>
      <p class="comment">Finally, the backups must be stored away from &quot;their data centre&quot;. <strong>Whose</strong> data centre? The &quot;they&quot; at the start of the sentence refers to HP, so HP is the subject of the sentence. Logically, the &quot;their&quot; should also refer to the previous subject - HP. So clients' backups should be stored away from HP's data centre?</p>
      <p class="comment">It's like &quot;Bill fell over Tom and hurt his head&quot; - whose head? Bill's or Tom's? It's hopelessly ambiguous.</p>
      <p class="comment">So, the article began by asking if businesses test their backups. It then leaps, for some unknown reason, to discussing big banks' data warehouses, and finally HP who perform unnamed obscure services for companies in dark alleys.</p>
      <p class="comment">I mean - what the...? </p>
      <p class="comment">Can kids, especially ESL kids, be expected to make sense of this? I did an English major at Melbourne Uni and have been working with IT since 1978 and this mangled article still confuses the hell out of me. </p>
      <p class="comment">Sorry folks, I'll calm down sometime next year, but OOOH, this makes me annoyed. </p>

The new system would give real-time and detailed performance figures based on numbers of orders taken, money taken, hours worked etc. It would not, however, record how well staff communicated with customers, so a staff member could take time to charm and delight the customers but the collated statistics would only register slow customer turnaround.</p>
      <p class="blue">Managers could mis-use the data to victimise staff who appeared not to be performing, and the ability to monitor staff actions in real-time may be viewed as unreasonable interference in staff's lives (e.g.counting how many apparent toilet breaks they've taken.)</p>

      <p class="comment">Thinks: I didn't much like this question. I'd appreciate it if anyone could suggest neat ethical issues. </p>
      <p class="comment">As one notable correspondent said, this question was paraphrased directly from a NSW computer science question found at their website. I hope the VCAA sought copyright permission to use it :-)</p>

      <p>Georgia, a student, suggested: <em>an ethical concern might be that the data from the iPAQs is being collected for one reason known to staff, which is to make order processing easier and to keep track of stock levels, etc, but then being using for monitoring their performance. So whilst not illegal b/c companies have a right to monitor their employees' performance, unethical b/c staff not aware that collected info will be used in this way. </em></p>

    <td ><p>Freshwater Ponds DVD Lending Library opens from 10.00 am to midnight, seven days a week, and plans to introduce a new cataloguing system called EasyCat. The library's four full-time and eight part-time staff will need to be trained in the use of the EasyCat program.</p>
      <p>a. EasyCat makes the following recommendations for training the library staff. </p>
      <p>For each recommendation, explain <strong>one</strong> concern you would have if it were implemented. (3x3 lines, 3 marks, <strong>SM=1.8</strong>) </p>
      <p>Recommendation 1:<span class="myanswer"> all library staff undertake training at the same time </span></p>
      <p class="myanswer">Training all staff at the same time will mean there will be no staff available to serve customers and conduct normal business while the training goes on! In effect, the organisation will cease operations for a time - hardly a desirable state of affairs. </p>
      <p class="myanswer">Also, it may be hard to find a time when all full-time and part-time staff are available. Part-timers might have to come in during their non-working time, which woulld be inconvenient to them, and/or expensive because of having to pay them overtime. </p>
      <p>Recommendation 2: <span class="myanswer">the training be conducted three weeks before the new system is installed </span></p>
      <p class="myanswer">Training <em>too</em> soon before implemementation may well mean that staff have forgotten their training by the time they have to use the system for real.</p>
      <p>Recommendation 3: <span class="myanswer">all staff be provided with a technical manual </span></p>
      <p class="myanswer">Training should only be given to staff who need it. Most staff would not <em>need</em> any detailed technical knowledge, and providing it to them would be a time-consuming and expensive waste of time. </p>
      <p>b. Explain your recommended training strategy for the library. Your strategy should cover location and timing, and provider and method of delivery (16 lines, 4 marks, <strong>SM=1.5</strong>) </p>
      <p class="myanswer">Remember: There are 4 full-timers and 8 part-timers. </p>
      <p class="myanswer">It would be best to train them in-house, if possible, for the sake of convenience and realism because they're training on the actual system they will later use. </p>
      <p class="myanswer">They should be trained shortly before the system is implemented - probably in the preceding week.</p>
      <p class="myanswer">The provider should preferably be an expert, such as the system's creator or distributor, or at least someone skilled in its operation. If the content of the material is relatively straightforward, it may be possible to train just the full-time staff and get them to train the part-timers in a &quot;train the trainer&quot; strategy.</p>
      <p class="myanswer">Because there are so few people to train, a small-group hands-on tutorial would be best. It would allow the tutor to talk to all the people, but also allow time for answering individual questions and solving individual difficulties. </p>
      <p>c. The chief librarian has indicated the following <strong>two </strong> areas she considers essential to be covered in the user manual. Justify the inclusion of each of these areas in the user manual provided to staff who hire out videos. (2x4 lines, 2 marks, <strong>SM=1.0</strong>) </p>
      <p>i. How to accurately calculate the hiring fee when hiring multiple videos to a client </p>
      <p class="myanswer">If staff cannot do this, they will may overcharge the client, resulting in ill-will and loss of future business, or they may undercharge the client, resulting in reduced profit - or even a loss. </p>
      <p>ii. How to save, backup and exit the system at the end of the day </p>
      <p class="myanswer">If staff cannot save data safely, data would be lost. This would result in uncertain financial and borrowing records.</p>
      <p class="myanswer">If staff cannot backup effectively, later recovery from data disaster (e.g. equipment failure, fire, equipment theft, virus attack) would be impossible. If unable to restore vital borrowing records, financial information, client lists, stock lists etc, the library would not likely be able to do business, and would probably collapse, or at least greatly suffer financially while operations were restored. </p>
      <p class="myanswer">Correct system shutdown procedures ensure files are closed properly and data in RAM is committed to permanent storage. Exiting improperly can lead to corruption of data, or damage to system files. </p>

      <p>A correspondent pointed out: </p>
      <em>A lending library has no hiring fees, to my knowledge, but rather overdue fees. <br />
        If there is a chief librarian, then you are really talking about a public library, not a business such as Video Sleazy.<br />
        But then again, I may not know enough about our public library system.</em>

Currently, Top Shades sends the supervisor to measure the windows on which the blinds will be installed. Then the supervisor estimates the cost, adds $100 to ensure the company makes a profit and provides the customer with a handwritten quote. Top Shades wants a more precise solution that allows any of the staff to complete a quote. They will all be sharing a laptop computer with an ink-jet printer connected. </p>

      <p>This question has produced more debate that most of the others. People are very unclear about it... e.g. </p>
      <p><em><font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nothing in the question implies that the solution is a database. It could be a dedicated program or, perhaps the easiest solution, a spreadsheet macro. Why should either of those go into a folder called &quot;client database&quot;? By default I would be placing the solution (non-database) in the &quot;Top Shades&quot; folder but I could make a case to place the spreadsheet in the clients folder with its output (perhaps in a sub-folder). In fact, why is there both a &quot;clients&quot; folder and a &quot;client db&quot; folder? Are they keeping client info in two different places? Surely that is highly inefficient and a potential problem for data integrity. </font></em></p>
      <p><em>and </em></p>
      <p> <font color="#000000" size="2" face="Arial"><span class="460080601-11112004"><em>13d is not clear at all. My kids interpreted that as the solution created for the quoting system which is similar to what they did for their outcome. This was saved as a template and then copied for each quote.&nbsp; I don't understand how the solution would go into a database folder when it sounds more like a spreadsheet solution. Wouldn't final quotes go into the client's folder? Guess it is how you interpret 'solution'.</em></span></font></p>
      <p class="comment">I interpreted the solution as a dedicated program that produced some sort of electronic document output - Q13e says that quotes are produced as separate documents (quote1, quote2, quote3 etc). It won't be a <em>real</em> database because databases keep their records internally, not as individual documents. I think the &quot;templates&quot; and &quot;stock&quot; folders are irrelevant to the question. It seemed clear that quotes would need to be stored in the 'clients' folder. The logical place to store the quote-producing software was the 'client database' folder, for want of something better.</p>
      <p class="comment">I didn't see anything really peculiar when I did Q13 - but I agree it is an odd beastie upon closer examination.</p>

      <p>e. The manager has suggested that files be named consecutively; for example, Quote 1, Quote 2, Quote 3. Explain <strong>two </strong> difficulties staff will have with this suggestion and recommend a more appropriate file-naming system. (3 marks, <strong>SM=1.85</strong>) </p>
      <p>Difficulty 1 (4 lines) -<span class="myanswer"> it would be impossible to find quotes for a particular client without opening and reading every quote! </span></p>
      <p>Difficulty 2 (4 lines) - <span class="myanswer">hmmm - when sorted by name, the quotes would soon be all over the shop because they are sorted alphabetically i.e. quote1, quote 10, quote 11 ... quote 19, quote 2, quote21</span></p>
      <p>Recommendation - <span class="myanswer">the filename should contain vital information e.g. client ID, job number for that client, version number, e.g. Quote-SMITH01-job003-v2.doc</span></p>
