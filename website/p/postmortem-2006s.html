<td><p>A3. Describe the major difference between the functions of a switch and a modem in a network. (1) </p>
<p class="blue">A switch is a device to interconnect network nodes so that devices can exchange data. They are commonly used to split one cable into many cables, like an electrical powerboard. Unlike hubs, switches are smart and only pass on traffic to devices that the traffic is intended for.</p>
<p class="blue">A modem on the other hand is the device that connects a computer to the outside world, usually the internet. </p>
<p class="comment"><em>Strictly speaking, a modem is an <strong>analogue</strong> device that <strong>mod</strong>ulates digital data into sound so it can upload over phone lines and <strong>dem</strong>odulate downloads of sound back into digital data. (Get it? MODulateDEModulate?) There is <strong>no way</strong> any modern network of any importance would use a real analogue modem - at a theoretical maximum download speed of 56kbps (and upload at 33.6kbps) it is far too slow, prone to data error and line dropouts, and it monopolises a phone line.</em></p>
<p class="comment"><em>A cable &quot;modem&quot; just splits internet data from cable TV data. It does not modulate/demodulate and is purely digital. <br />
An ADSL &quot;modem&quot; is also not really a modem because it put digital data over a standard phone line at a frequency that does not interfere with normal voice signals. </em></p>

<p class="comment"><em>Notice it said &quot;efficiently&quot;, not &quot;effectively&quot;, so we're concerned with saving time, money and labour: we are NOT interested in quality, accuracy, safety etc. I hope the examiners notice this too!</em></p>
<p class="comment"><em>Routers have 3 functions:</em></p>
<p class="comment"><em>1) they can be programmed to protect a LAN from undesirable incoming traffic, and can kill unwanted outgoing traffic.</em></p>
<p class="comment"><em>2) they can divide a LAN into discrete sections with different privileges. For example in a school the teachers' admin network is logically separated from the students' curriculum network by the router. Staff can see the student network, but students are prevented from seeing the admin network by the smart router. While it seems there are two separate networks, they are in fact one.</em></p>
<p class="comment"><em>3) they guide TCP/IP packets from their source to their destination across LANs and the internet. Routers come in all sizes from paperback-sized home router boxes to room-sized supercomputers used by telcom giants like Telstra and AT&amp;T. </em></p>
<p class="comment"><em>Now, how can they make a &quot;large network run more <strong>efficiently</strong>&quot;?</em></p>
<p class="myanswer">Saving time: they prevent unwanted incoming packets that would have to be dealt with by the LAN. They help prevent hackers entering a LAN, thereby saving time having to be spent recovering from data destruction or theft. Routers direct packets efficiently to their destination, thereby saving users time waiting for uploads and downloads to finish. </p>
<p class="myanswer">Saving money: data loss by intruders can be hideously expensive. Re-creating lost data is massively expensive and disruptive. </p>
<p class="myanswer">Saving effort: since the router protects the LAN from hackers, less effort is required to maintain it. Dividing the LAN into discrete sections with a router can make one group of users (e.g. the payroll department) invisible to other users (e.g. greedy sales staff) so less work needs to be done enforcing network security. </p>

<p><em>EFFECTIVENESS = A measure of how well something works, such as an information
system, file management strategies and an information product, and the
extent to which it achieves its intended results. Measures of an effective
information system include reliability and maintainability. Measures of
an effective information product include completeness, readability, attractiveness,

<td ><p><br />
Lucy is the owner of Lucky Orchids which specialises in growing orchids for the pot plant market. Her nursery, 
a 600 square metre heated greenhouse, is located next to her house in country Victoria. At most times during 
the year there are 100 000 plants growing in the nursery. The orchids are worth about $2 000 000.</p>
<p><strong>Lucy&rsquo;s current system</strong></p>
<p> So she can grow the best orchids, Lucy has to have different growing conditions at different stages of a plant&rsquo;s
life. For example, her seedlings and younger plants require less light, a higher temperature and higher humidity
than older plants. To achieve this, Lucy has divided the greenhouse into three rooms.</p>
<p>Each room has its own set of climate control units as shown in Figure 1 on the following page. They can be set
according to the needs of the plants in that room.</p>
<p>For example, for Lucy&rsquo;s flowering plants</p>
<p>&bull; if the light exceeds 15 000 lux (a measure of light brightness), shade curtains are automatically pulled across
the roof<br />
&bull; if the humidity rises above 80%, the mist sprayers are turned off<br />
&bull; if the temperature is above 25&deg;C, vents are opened to allow fresh air into the greenhouse.</p>
<p>Each unit operates independently and automatically although sometimes one will fail. This can have serious
consequences for Lucy&rsquo;s plants and she can only check each unit by going into the greenhouse and reading various
climate gauges in the greenhouse. For example, if heaters fail at night she will not know until the morning when
she physically checks the thermometer. Cool overnight temperatures will cause her plants to grow more slowly or even kill them. Failure to control light or humidity may also cause damage. Unfortunately, Lucy cannot be
in the nursery every day because of personal and business commitments.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/m/pm/06s-insert1.jpg" width="390" height="546" /></p>
<p>
With the current system, Lucy can grow plants from seedling to flowering in 2.5 years. On a recent trip to
Holland, to purchase new varieties of plants, she noted that Dutch nurseries were growing plants from seedling
to flowering in 1.5 to 2 years. The reason for this is that the climate in their greenhouses is computer controlled.
All the sensors and climate control devices are connected to a computer. A computer program then maintains ideal growing conditions. For example, if the temperature gets too high, shade curtains are activated regardless

<p><strong>Lucy&rsquo;s new system</strong></p>
<p> Lucy recently purchased a new nursery five kilometres from her house. It has unheated greenhouses covering
3000 square metres of land. Because her new greenhouses will have to be upgraded for her orchids, Lucy
decides that she wants to introduce a computer controlled climate system into both her existing local nursery
and her new remote nursery.</p>
<p> She would like this computer climate control system to<br />
&bull; combine control of all climate devices to produce better conditions for orchid growth<br />
&bull; allow her to remotely check and alter the conditions in each greenhouse room in both nurseries<br />
&bull; record errors and send an alert message to her mobile phone if something fails.</p>
<p>Lucy imagines that the new system will be something like that shown in Figures 2 and 3. </p>

<p> Lucy describes the temperature control to Susan.</p>
<p> The temperature in a greenhouse room is constantly monitored and if it falls below 19&deg;C a heater is turned on. 
If the temperature rises above 21&deg;C the heater is turned off. When the temperature goes over 25&deg;C vents are
opened to allow fresh air into the room and if it gets hotter than 29&deg;C evaporative cooling is turned on. Once
the temperature drops below 24&deg;C vents are closed and cooling stops.</p>

<p><strong>Question 5</strong></p>
<p> Lucy has decided against the shareware program and buys the Dutch software. After installing it, her friend
Peter, who is a programmer, is convinced that the Dutch software has some major faults. He has offered to fix
these problems for Lucy, free of charge. </p>
<p>Explain the legal obligations and/or ethical considerations that Lucy should think about before she accepts or
rejects Peter&rsquo;s offer to alter the program code. 4 marks</p>
<p class="blue">The first obligation is copyright. Assuming the
software is a compiled executable (and not interpreted from source code),
it would need to be decompiled or reverse-engineered to modify it, and

need to ascertain that the licence agreement authorised customers to
modify their software. </p>

<p><b>Question 7</b></p>
<p>
One of the errors that Peter has found is in the code to control the shade curtain motor.<br />
For her flowering orchids, Lucy wants the shade curtain to be closed if the light exceeds 15 000 lux (MaxLight).
She also wants the shade curtain closed when the temperature exceeds 33&deg;C (MaxTemp). The curtain should
only be opened when the light falls below 7 000 lux (MinLight) and when the temperature drops below 30&deg;C
(MinTemp). The light and temperature values will vary depending on the plants grown in each greenhouse &lsquo;room&rsquo;.<br />
Peter has found that the code follows the algorithm below. </p>
<p><strong>Begin</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>If </strong>Temperature &gt; MaxTemp <strong>Or</strong> Light &gt;MaxLight <strong>Then</strong></p>

<p><b>Question 9</b></p>
<p>
Lucy wishes to connect the computer in the local nursery with a computer in her house so she can monitor the
greenhouse from her study. The distance is approximately 30 metres. She has two choices.</p>
<p> Option 1: to connect via CAT-5 cable<br />
Option 2: to set up a wireless link</p>
<p>
Select the better option for Lucy. Justify your selection by comparing the two options. 
2 marks</p>
<p class="comment"><em>Both options are clearly viable, and I feel a
student could argue persuasively for either one: the <b>argument</b> rather
than the <b>actual choice</b> will be the important factor.</em></p>
<p class="blue">30m is well within CAT5's 100m range. Wireless will also manage 30m comfortably if there are no significant obstacles in the line of sight. Wireless is also quite reliable and cheap nowadays. The deciding factor for me is the difficulty in threading 30 metres of CAT5 between the house and the greenhouse. Putting it underground would require conduit and digging trenches is a difficult job. It also runs the risk of being cut by careless diggers. If the cable were strung aerially, it would also require protection from UV, and it risks being snagged by tall vehicles. Also, once cable is put in place, it is difficult to move or remove later: wireless is far more flexible. I'd go for the wireless option. </p>

<p>
Option 1: Use dial up Internet &ndash; get the computer to use the Internet by dialling in every 5 minutes.<br />
Option 2: Use broadband instead of dial up Internet.<br />
Option 3: Set up a microwave link.<br />
</p>
<p class="blue">1. Dialup - cheap, basic equipment requirements. Quick and easy to set up. Cheap internet plan. </p>
<p class="blue">2. Broadband - will not tie up a phone line. Can be used for other internet needs at home and at the remote greenhouse. Fast. Reliable.</p>
<p class="blue">3. Microwave - it would impress animals and small children, but that's about it. It's not a serious contender. I guess students could say its ferocious speed and massive bandwidth would be ideal to send 2KB of data every 5 minutes!</p>

c. Select the best possible option for Lucy. Justify your selection by discussing the three options above. 
3 marks</p>
<p class="blue">Go for option 2. </p>
<p class="blue">Dialup may be cheap in terms of equipment, but consider the running costs: dialing 288 times a day at 18c per call would cost $51.84 per DAY! </p>
<p class="blue">Two cheap ADSL plans could be bought for $40 a MONTH, and small download allowances would not be a problem with the small amount of data that would be sent (288 calls * 2K = half a meg a day = 15M per month.) </p>

Peter has agreed to write a program that will store the data for this purpose. His preferred programming language

file. </p>

3 marks</p>
<p class="comment"><em>I don't know why she doesn't just use an off-the-shelf DBMS, but anyway... </em></p>
<p class="blue">Sequential access requires one to read through all the data between the beginning of the file and the desired point where the data resides... think of having to wind through video tape to get to the third episode recorded on it.</p>
<p class="blue">Random access allows the input device to jump immediately to the place in the file that contains the desired data, making it quicker. However, for random acess to work, the structure of records must be determined in advance, and the length of each record must be uniform. </p>
<p class="blue">A sequential file permits records of varying length, and their data tends to be ASCII, which makes it easier to import and export between applications. </p>

<p><b>Question 16</b></p>
<p>
After Lucy&rsquo;s system had been set up and working for about three months, a data security company contacted Lucy
about backing up her data. This company uses the Internet to transfer customer data to their storage facilities.
The company has made the following three claims about their service.</p>
<p>
Claim 1: Lucy would not need to worry about the backup, they would do it all for her.<br />
Claim 2: Lucy would always be able to access the backup.<br />
Claim 3: They would keep Lucy&rsquo;s backup on a very secure site that is well away from the nurseries.</p>
<p>
Discuss what Lucy needs to investigate before accepting each claim. 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 marks</p>
<p>Claim 1</p>
<ul>
<li class="blue">How are they planning to get remote access to her system - do they need to have her passwords?</li>
<li class="blue">    At what time of day are they going to do the backup? Is it going to interfere with her use of her system?</li>
<li class="blue">    Does her internet plan charge for uploads as well as downloads? Will such backups eat up her monthly traffic allowance?
</li>
<li class="blue">    What is their backup strategy? Do they overwrite previous backups too soon? Can data be recovered from any time in the past? </li>
<li class="blue">    How reliable is the security company - what sort of reputation they have? Can they be trusted? </li>
<li class="blue">    If they lose her data or damage her system, what compensation do they guarantee? </li>
<li class="blue">    If Lucy suffers a system failure and it turns out that the company had failed to carry out effective backups and Lucy could not recover her lost data, how would the company atone for its sins? </li>
</ul>
<p>Claim 2</p>
<ul>
<li class="blue">How would she access the backup? Is it web-based, FTP? Is it password protected?</li>
<li class="blue"> Is the connection a secure SSL link? </li>
<li class="blue">How long would it take to download a backup?</li>
<li class="blue">Is access available 24x7, even on public holidays? </li>
<li class="blue">If Lucy's system failed completely, including the internet connection, how would she get her backups? Would they mail her the backup on DVD, for example?</li>
<li class="blue">Does she need any special software to access the backup? </li>
<li class="blue">Is 24x7 help available? </li>
</ul>
<p class="blue"> Claim 3</p>
<ul>
<li class="blue">Where in the world are they based? Are they subject to Australian Information Privacy laws?</li>
<li class="blue">Do they have a privacy policy?</li>
<li class="blue">Just how secure is the company's storage facilities? e.g. are her backups encrypted?</li>
</ul>
<p class="comment"><em>I always thought online backup schemes were boogeymen invented by examiners
to scare young IT students around the campfire... but they exist - <a href="http://www.idrive.net.au/">like
this</a> (and the link is NOT a recommendation!) </em></p>

<td><p><b>Question 17</b></p>
<p>
When the system was being designed, Lucy produced a list of objectives for the new system. </p>
<p>Objective 1: The temperature, light and humidity do not go outside the set limits.<br />
Objective 2: No more than two errors in a month will be recorded.<br />
Objective 3: Record all errors and immediately send an alert message to her mobile phone. </p>
<p class="comment"><em>Objective 2 is <b>really </b>badly worded. It sounds like that of all the errors that happen in a month, only two of them will be recorded in the log. All the others will be ignored! What the question is trying to say is &quot;No more than two errors will happen in a month.&quot; </em></p>
<p>After six months of operation, Lucy thinks that her new greenhouse climate control system is a success. However,
she wants some data to support her feeling, so she has checked the error log from both nursery computers. The
content of the error log is shown below. </p>

a. For Objective 1, indicate the data that informs Lucy that the objective is<b> not being met</b>. 
1 mark </p>
<p class="blue">&quot;greenhouse too hot&quot;, &quot;greenhouse too bright&quot; </p>
<p class="comment"><em>Note that I did not select &quot;mist sprayers malfunction&quot;
nor &quot;vents stuck&quot;.&nbsp; They
may eventually CAUSE temperature or humidity to go out of range, but they
are not the SAME as temperature or humidity going out of range.&nbsp; Both
may malfunction without the undesirable result taking place! </em></p>
<p>b. For Objective 2, indicate the data that informs Lucy that the objective<b> is being met</b>. 
1 mark </p>
<p class="comment"><em>Assuming you have mentally re-written Objective 2 so it makes sense... </em></p>
<p class="myanswer">There is no month with more than 2 faults recorded. </p>
<p>c. What additional data needs to be checked to evaluate if <b>Objective 3</b> has been met? Explain. 
2 marks</p>
<p class="myanswer">If every error in the log has a matching message in her phone's message history, she can be assured objective 3 has been met. </p>
