<p class="myanswer">This is a strange question. <br />
What on earth is a 'keyboard swipe', pray tell? If it's a swipe <em>card</em> reader mounted on a keyboard, the examiners should have made that a lot clearer. If it's not that, Dog only knows what it means. Anyway, I'll eliminate it.<br />
Encryption does not <em>detect</em> anything. It makes information unreadable to unauthorised people.<br />
Antivirus 
software has got nothing to do with it.<br />
That leaves only C - and CCTV is hardly a main ICT tool. Strange.

<td ><p>After considerable debate amongst IT teachers, noone has any real clue about what the answer is. </p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Keyboard swipe&quot; does not exist. A keyboard-mounted swipe card reader might exist, but the question did not say that.</li>
<li>The question could have meant &quot;prevent&quot; instead of &quot;access&quot;, but it didn't say that.</li>

<p class="myanswer">Be careful with these questions. Miss that &quot;H&quot; in &lt;C&gt; and you'd be misled. It is VLOOKUP (looking up vertically) so &lt;B&gt; is out.<br />
Multiplying by D2 makes no sense in giving a discount rate, so rule out &lt;D&gt;.<br />
When filling formulas down, parts of cell references prefixed by $ are locked so they stay the same as the formula is copied to new locations. We want references to I5 and J8 to stay like that regardless of where the formulas are copied to, so it points to the right range of cells containing the table. So both the rows (5,8) and columns 
(I,J) need the dollar signs.</p>

<p class="myanswer">This is new one to me. We've always handed goals and objectives, and strategic/tactical timeframes, but I've not seen them combined like this. The better students probably managed to think it through.<br />
The 20% indicates a specific objective, so rule out &lt;A&gt; and &lt;B&gt;. The long timeframe smells like a big strategic ambition. The only
matching combination is &lt;D&gt;.</p>

<p>IT trainers are paid by Wendy. They email their invoices for payment to Wendy and they are paid after Wendy has completed the administrative process.<br />
Wendy is taking leave and she needs to provide a flowchart of the process for her replacement. Which flowchart best represents the process?</p>

<p class="myanswer">Answer is A.</p>
<p class="myanswer">You need to be calm and logical with these scary looking decision trees. Once again, ruling out dumb options is an easy strategy.<br />
In &lt;C&gt; we have a decision arrow not branching from a decision. That does not happen in proper flowcharts.<br />

It was disappointing that many students did not score a mark on this question. Validation and testing are key topics in<br />
both units of this study; it is important that students understand the theory associated with each and are able to apply<br />
their knowledge of these topics to given situations</span></p>

<p class="examiner">Many students recognised that setting the No. of Tickets field to a text data type could cause a problem when the data<br />
entered was multiplied. For example:<br />
&bull; the ticket number needs to be an integer such as 5, not five. It will not calculate a Total Cost $ because it<br />
cannot multiply text data<br />
&bull; it will give an error because 5 is treated as text.</p>

&bull; in a close secure/fireproof location where they can be easily used as part of the regular backup<br />
&bull; in an offsite location where they can be retrieved quickly but not damaged if a fire occurs in the building<br />
A range of other reasonable responses were accepted. In general, responses to this question were pleasingly comprehensive and coherent. Most answers discussed backup media, a backup schedule and a location for the storage of backup files. Many students referred to the rapid increase in sales or online sales when justifying recommendations for BandicootPhones.</p>

</td>
<td height="84" valign="top"><p align="left">A company sells fashion items online to customers who sign up and login to its website with a FashionUserlD. As part of the sign-up process customers complete an online form that includes their email address, mailing address, favourite colours and annual salary.<br />
Cheryl manages the database of customer details and the web pages where the images and prices of fashion items are displayed.<br />
Cheryl's boss has asked her to create a second set of web pages so that customers who earn more than $50 000 a year see web pages with prices 20% higher than normal.</p>
<p align="left" class="myanswer"><em>Huh? Who in their right mind would supply their annual salary to a shopping website? This is just silly.</em></p>
<p align="left">a.<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/indent.lbi" -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- #EndLibraryItem --> Describe how Cheryl can use the database to decide what web page should be shown to each customer. 2 marks</p>
<p align="left" class="myanswer">'Use a script.'</p>
<p align="left" class="myanswer"><em>Damned if I know. What is this question getting at? I can only assume it's a CMS if it contains customer information AND webpages. There must be some scripting available (I've played with Joomla and have not found any scripting - yet) which selects a page based on some field value in the customer database.</em></p>
<p align="left" class="myanswer"><em>Dog only knows what students made of this. How many of them have worked with CMS websites, or know how they work? Were the examiners just expecting a uselessly-vague answer like &quot;use a script&quot;. I bet that's the best they will get from most students, and they'd better be happy giving marks for it.</em> </p>
<p align="left" class="myanswer"><em>In last year's infamous spreadsheet question they expected &quot;Use a macro&quot; even though it was patently an absurd solution. Have the examiners drifted off into unrealistic fairy technology land again?</em></p>
<p align="left" class="myanswer"><em>Don't like that question at all.</em> </p>
<p class="myanswer"><span class="red">State average was 1.0</span></p>
<p align="left" class="red">Responses that described a technique which could be used to identify customers who would be directed to the website with higher prices received full marks. Examples included:<br />
&bull; filter/sort the customer salary field into those who earn over $50 000 and show them the higher prices<br />
&bull; use an IF statement to direct higher earners to a second web page or where normal prices are replaced by higher prices.</p>
<p align="left"> b. What question would you ask Cheryl about the ethics of creating a second set of web pages for customers who earn more than $50 000 per year? 1 mark</p>
<ul>
<li class="myanswer">Do you feel comfortable using information that customers supplied in good faith to rip them off?</li>
<li class="myanswer">Why don't you tell your boss you won't do it?</li>
<li class="myanswer">Do you see how this is an unethical thing to do?</li>
</ul>
<p align="left" class="myanswer"><em>Again, I can't see the point of this question. Why would you question Cheryl at all - it's not her fault what her boss orders. I know that these ethics questions are always difficult to think up - and this one is not a good one.</em> </p>
<p class="myanswer"><span class="red">State average was 0.5</span></p>
<p align="left" class="red">Responses that asked the Cheryl a question about deception or dishonesty were awarded a mark. For example, 'Do you think it's right to make people secretly pay more just because they work hard to make more money?'.</p>
<p align="left"><br />
c. What question would you ask Cheryl's boss about the ethics of asking Cheryl to create the second set of web pages? 2 marks</p>
<ul>
<li class="myanswer">How dare you use customer information to rip them off?</li>
<li class="myanswer">What sort of pea-brained moronic half-wit are you?</li>
<li class="myanswer">Don't you see that using customer-supplied information against them is immoral?</li>
<li class="myanswer">Hey, I like the way you don't let morality stand in the way of profit. Can I buy shares in your company? </li>
</ul>
<p class="myanswer"><span class="red">State average was 0.6</span></p>
<p class="examiner">Responses that asked the boss a question about the fairness of ordering or bullying an employee to create a hidden link to a second set of 'rip-off' web pages were awarded full marks. For example, 'Do you think it's right to make a junior employee do something that is morally wrong when you are in the position to fire her?'.<br />
It was of concern that many students either did not attempt to answer this question or provided an incorrect answer. This 
indicated that students had limited understanding about ethics and strategies for handling ethics and IT, and more focus should be placed on these areas.</p>
<p align="left"> d.&nbsp;&nbsp; Recommend a strategy IT staff could follow when they are not sure if their work is ethical. 2 marks</p>
<ul>
<li class="myanswer">Talk to their boss about their concerns.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Ask their mothers.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Set up an ethics committee.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Google &quot;IT ethics&quot;.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Ask themselves, &quot;What would Bill Gates do in a case like this&quot;?</li>
<li class="myanswer">Refer to their preferred holy book and do whatever it says.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Ask a passing priest.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Phone a philosopher.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Ask themselves if they are feeling uncomfortable because of an ethical quandary, or whether it was just the curry they had for lunch.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left" class="myanswer"><em>O, I don't know or care any more. Too many marks given to damned ethical questions for one exam!</em> </p>
<p class="myanswer"><span class="red">State average was 0.7</span></p>
<p align="left" class="myanswer"><em>The poor performance of students in these 4 questions says more about the quality of the questions than the ability of the students, I reckon.</em></p>
<p align="left" class="red">Suggested strategies that IT staff could follow when they are not sure if their work is ethical, included:<br />
&bull; ask for guidelines about customers' rights to privacy to be posted on the office noticeboard<br />
&bull; have regular specialist training sessions for IT staff about privacy<br />
&bull; post a written procedure on the company Intranet for staff to follow if they think they are being asked to invade privacy.<br />
Responses that included an action and a means of communicating with the IT group were awarded full marks.</p>

<p align="left" class="red">Responses which received full marks outlined two main steps of a procedure to test that the hard drive completed a weekly full backup effectively. For example, record data changes for one week on a second hard drive and then compare the data to see if it was the same/complete/accurate.

<p class="examiner">Responses which outlined reasonable steps to test the hardware shutdown procedure without risking the transaction data were awarded full marks. Examples included:<br />
&bull; Jack could plan for a time when business was slow then shut down, restart and compare the transaction files<br />
&bull; tell all users about a test in time for them to back up data, then shut down, start up and check all files are undamaged.</p>

<p align="left" class="myanswer">The number of illegal logins that happened per month after the new procedure was introduced. </p>
<p align="left">Justification</p>
<p align="left" class="myanswer">The whole point of the new procedure was to reduce the number of illegal logins. Logically, that is the criterion that must be used to see if the new procedure has been effective. </p>
<p class="myanswer"><span class="red">State average was 0.8</span></p>
<p align="left" class="red">The most successful students responded in the form of a question; for example, 'Have there been fewer than 25 illegal logins in the 12 months since the new procedure was introduced?'. Students who clearly justified why you would compare the number of illegal logins in a particular period of time were awarded full marks. For example:<br />
&bull; after 12 months, staff would have changed passwords four times<br />
&bull; there would be time to see if the three-month period was long enough in order to reduce the number illegal logins<br />
&bull; there must be fewer than 25 illegal logins in three months for the new procedure to be effective.</p>

<p align="left" class="myanswer">All security software must be regularly updated as new system security weakness are discovered and new exploits and dangerous technologies are developed. Relying on old technology (like old antivirus definitions) leaves you vulnerable to new threats. </p>

<p align="left" class="myanswer"><em>Another set of questions for which the state average never hit 50%. Can't blame the questions this time, however.</em></p>
<p align="left" class="red">Full marks were awarded to responses that provided good financial reasons for regularly updating firewall software, including:<br />
&bull; hackers are always finding new ways to get around security<br />
&bull; firewalls help to protect our customer data<br />
