&bull; send data from roadside logger to central computer<br />

&bull; transfer data from CDU to RDL<br />
&bull; send data to parking officers.<br />
Functional requirements are statements about what the system is required to do; however, when responding to this
question, many students confused functional and non-functional requirements. Reliability, robustness and
maintainability were common answers, but these are all non-functional requirements.</span></p></td>

Many students were unable to write solution requirements, and confused functional and  non-functional requirements.<br />
          Throughout the year, clear and concise solution requirements should be modelled (using dot points, numbered lists,  tables, etc.), where appropriate, in design briefs and SRS. In addition, students should practise identifying and writing  appropriate solution requirements from provided stimulus material.        </p>

        <p>An application is designed that will record a person's heart rate every 10 minutes and keep a record of the heart rate readings for a week. What would be the functional requirements for this software?<br />
          <strong>A.</strong> The	application is reliable and stores the heart rates for a week. <br />
          <strong>B.</strong> The	application records the heart rates and stores them for a week. <br />
          <strong>C.</strong> The	application is easy to turn on and off, and keeps accurate readings. <br />
          <strong>D.</strong> The	application records the heart rates and provides a user-friendly screen.</p>
        <p class="myanswer">Answer is B. </p>
        <p class="myanswer">Functional requirements are those that need to be specifically programmed into an application so it can achieve a particular task.</p>
        <p class="myanswer">Non-functional requirements are qualities that the software must possess, but are not necessarily coded in. They could, for example, be achieved by effective design of an interface.</p>
        <p class="myanswer">In short, remember if you can say &quot;The program must <strong>be able to</strong>...&quot; followed by a verb - it's a functional requirement. <br />
          If you can say, &quot;The program must <strong>be</strong>...&quot; followed by an adjective, it's a non-functional requirement.</p>
