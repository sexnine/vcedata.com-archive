B. the colour printer manual.<br />
C. an email to the IT technician.<br />
D. a quick reference card on the colour printer.</p>

The best design tool for representing the relationships between pages in the wiki on a website is a<br />
A. flow chart.<br />
B. storyboard.<br />
C. structure chart.<br />
D. screen mock-up.</p>
<p class="myanswer">The <em>official</em> answer is C, but I think there is a case for B. A storyboard shows what pages/slides are in a site/slideshow/animation and how navigation occurs between them. Flowcharts design processes.<br />
Structure charts lay out the structure of complex (usually hierarchical) systems, such as tables and relationships in a database. They <em>could</em> also describe a wiki, but I think a storyboard is more useful.<br />
Screen mockup gives an indication of what a component will look like. </p>

C. indicates completion of a task that allows evaluation of the project to date.<br />
D. occurs when a number of tasks are done simultaneously creating spare time.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Answer is C. It is a diamond in a Gantt chart; B refers to a predecessor; D is hinting at slack. Milestones are points of progress and help project managers gauge whether they are running on time or not. Milestones have zero duration since they are not tasks that have to be carried out: they just <em>happen</em>.</p>

C. =SUM(B3:B5)<br />

C. =C3:C5-C9:11<br />
D. =C9+C10+C11-C3-C4-C5</p>
<p class="myanswer">Answer is B. Subtract total expenses (C12) from total income (C6). Not too hard... D would give the right answer but it recalculates values that have already been calculated, making it less efficient.

<p class="myanswer">Using the data provided, D12 (total March income) is 1400+150+800 = $2350. D6 is 2500+30+20 = $2550. </p>
<p class="myanswer">Plugging those figures into the formula gives
=IF(2350&lt;2550,&quot;HOORAY&quot;,&quot; &quot;).<br />
Since 2350 is less than 2550, the 'true' condition of the IF is calculated: the literal text <em>Hooray.</em><br />
There are no double quotes displayed in the cell, so it's not D.

Cell protection is most appropriate for all Column A and<br />
A. B14:E14<br />
B. B3:E5 and B9:Ell<br />
C. B6:E6 and B12:E12<br />
D. B6:E6 and B12:E14</p>
<p class="myanswer">Answer is D. Cell protection is to prevent formulas being typed over. <br />
Option A only protects the <strong>Total ($) </strong>formulae. <br />
Option B is immediately ruled out because it protects the cells that should be typed in.<br />
Option C protects formulae, but not as many as option D.</p>
<p class="comment">This question could confuse some students since in Excel you identify the cells that should be left <strong>unprotected</strong>, and then apply protection to the whole worksheet. The unprotected cells are available to be typed in, everything else is protected. This is slightly unintuitive and might cause some students to select the data cells (option B) as these are the cells they would actually nominate when applying cell protection in Excel. The students' response rate will be interesting to see when it's announced.</p>

<p><strong>Question 11</strong></p>
<p>
In the one-to-many relationship between the Student table and the Print Job table<br />
A. one record in the Student table relates to many records in the Print Job table<br />
B. one field in the Student table relates to many records in the Print Job table.<br />
C. one record in the Student table relates to many fields in the Print Job table.<br />
D. one field in the Student table relates to many fields in the Print Job table.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Answer is A. <em>Tricky one! Makes you stop and think... </em></p>
<p class="myanswer">It's a one-to-many relationship (indicated by the 1 and infinity sign on the relationship arrow) which means the &quot;one&quot; end (student) can appear many times in the &quot;many&quot; end (print jobs). All of the options agree about that. That's not the issue.</p>
<p class="myanswer">In the relationship, what is actually related? A record or a field within a record? A (key) field is used to <em>identify</em> a record, but it's the entire record that is related. <br />
Thus, the StudentID field in the Print Job table is the field that contains the student's identifier (ID) that enables the full student record in the Student Table to be found and its fields accessed.</p>
<p class="myanswer">So, one <em>record</em> in the print job table such as </p>
<p class="myanswer">JobID: 12345<br />
Teacher ID:<br />
StudentID: S222<br />
Date: 25Dec09<br />
B&amp;W or Colour: B&amp;W</p>
<p class="myanswer">contains the <em>field</em> StudentID which allows the <em>record</em> of student ID S222 to be found in the Student Table from where his/her name, DOB <em>fields</em> etc can be retrieved. </p>

A task performed by a network operating system (NOS) includes<br />
A. saving a file to a laptop hard drive.<br />
B. authenticating users' access to the network printer.<br />
C. changing the mouse click speed for a new user at a workstation.<br />
D. displaying an alert when a flash drive is first plugged into a workstation.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Answer is B. It's fairly damned obvious that a NOS is related to <strong>network</strong> matters. All the other options are purely workstation-based. </p>

<p class="myanswer">Answer is B.</p>
<p class="myanswer">In order:<br />
Can't be A because serial number data is not purely numeric. It's alphanumeric and can't be stored in a numeric field.<br />
Could be B. Give it a tick.<br />
Can't be C because Boolean only allows &quot;Yes/No&quot; type data.<br />
Can't be D for the same reason.<br />
So go for B.</p>

<p><strong>Question 19</strong></p>
<p>
The emergency plan within a disaster recovery strategy should include<br />
A. evacuation procedures for backup files and a schedule for reinstalling software.<br />
B. a schedule for reinstalling software and evacuation procedures for computers.<br />
C. hardware shutdown procedures and evacuation procedures for backup files.<br />
D. software supplier contact details and hardware shutdown procedures. </p>
<p class="myanswer">Answer is C.</p>
<p class="myanswer">I very <em>nearly</em> gave this a Shmacko until I read the stem more carefully. It's referring to the emergency plan<strong> WITHIN</strong> a disaster recovery strategy. This section would describe what to do <strong>during</strong> the emergency. The rest of the document would describe what to do <strong>after</strong> the emergency when recovering from it. So we need to rule out &quot;post emergency&quot; actions such as reinstalling software (A, B) and supplier contact details (so you can get new copies of the software that was destroyed: option D.)</p>
<p class="myanswer">The only option that only describes a plan of what to do <strong>during</strong> the emergency is C.</p>

<p><strong>Question 20</strong></p>
<p>
Task X has 20 days duration and Task Y has 15 days duration. Task X is a predecessor of Task Y. Task Y cannot start until 10 days after Task X has finished.<br />
If Tasks X and Y are on the critical path, the 10 days of delay for Task Y is called<br />
A. lag.<br />
B. lead.<br />
C. start to start time out.<br />
D. finish to finish time out.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Answer is A.</p>
<p class="comment">Fascinating! This is the first time I can remember the examiners going beyond really basic project management terms. I gloss over lag and lead times in class, just to be sure, but I sure don't stress them. I'd say this is one of those &quot;A+&quot; discriminator questions.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Lag is the time a task must wait even though its predecessor has finished. Think of task X as &quot;Pouring a concrete slab&quot; and task Y as &quot;Erecting the walls&quot;. Yes, task Y can't begin before task X ends, but it still can't start immediately: the cement must have time to cure. That is the 10 days' lag time.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Lead time is the opposite. It can happen where a task <em>theoretically</em> has to wait for a predecessor to finish, but in practice a start can be made before the predecessor is completely finished. e.g. if emptying a computer room before rewiring the electrics, the sparkies could start work before <strong>every</strong> desk and computer were removed.</p>
<p class="myanswer">As for options C and D, I haven't got the foggiest idea what they're about, so since I'm already happy with &quot;lag&quot;, I'll ignore them. Since I have the luxury of Google, I looked them up and there were no hits for either term. The closest Google got was <em>&quot;When is the best time to start 'time out' with children?&quot;</em></p>

<p align="left"><strong>Layout</strong> and <strong>Relevance</strong> are two design elements to be evaluated in the website shown above.</p>
<p align="left"> a. Describe how each of these design elements have been applied in this website.</p>
<p align="left">Layout</p>
<p align="left" class="myanswer">Heading is bold and appears at the top.<br />
Nav bar is shaded to make it stand apart from the other material on the page. <br />
Key information is vertically aligned in the middle of the screen with bold headings.<br />
Plenty of white space means information is not crowded, small or hard to find.
</p>
<p>Explanations</p>
<p class="myanswer">Bold headings clearly identify the content of the material below, making information easier to find.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Highlighted navbar clearly identifies the text there are being different to other text in that it can be clicked.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Aligning related items reinforces the fact that they belong together.</p>
<p class="myanswer">White space allows items to be visually separated and made more distinct. It can also group related items (e.g. the four squares each have an icon, a bold heading, the &quot;click for&quot; text, then the description of the information that is linked to.</p>
<p>Relevance</p>
<p class="myanswer">All of the information on the screen is related to the products and services offered by the water company. e.g. The navbar links are the sorts of things people would expect to find on such a page.</p>
<p>Explanation</p>
<p class="myanswer">Irrelevant information wastes space and confuses people who must try to work out why it's there. Visitors want a site to deliver the information they expect to find there, and they expect to be able to find that information quickly and easily.</p>
<p>6 marks</p>
<p><span class="red">State average for this question was 46%</span></p>
<p>b. Identify one audience characteristic that has been considered when producing this website. Explain how it has been considered.</p>
<p class="myanswer">One characteristic is that visitors would be concerned about how to reduce their water consumption to help the environment. It has been considered by offering ideas and services to help them achieve this aim (e.g. how to reach a lower water usage target, and how to exchange their showerheads.)</p>

<h3 align="center">Fun for the whole family</h3>
<p align="center">The challenge is to create the delivery docket spreadsheet exactly as described in the ITA exam question B12e</p>
<h3 align="center">without using mail merge!</h3>
<p align="center">And since the question says for you to &quot;<strong>automatically </strong>create a delivery slip for <strong>each </strong>customer&quot;, <br />
it means <strong>each</strong> customer, not just one.<br />
And it should be <strong>automatic</strong>, not manual.</p>
<p align="center">Best of luck.</p>
<p align="center">A <a href="/m/pm/09i-B12prototype.xls">spreadsheet starting point</a> is available for anyone who wants to play. It's the best I could manage. Ignore it if you prefer.<br />
Remember: there should be <em>no blank lines</em> in the list of items on the delivery slip.</p>
