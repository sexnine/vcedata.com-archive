    <p class="examiner">Students performed well in Section A of the 2010 paper; however, some students did not answer all multiple-choice questions. It is important for students to provide responses to all multiple-choice questions. Throughout the year it may be appropriate for students to practise answering this type of question.</p>
    <p class="examiner">Section B provided a challenge for many students. This section required students to demonstrate sound theoretical knowledge and to provide detailed and accurate responses.</p>
    <p class="examiner"> In Section C, student responses were expected to apply the case study to the questions asked. This year the algorithm question (Section C, Question 9) was challenging for many students.</p>
    <p class="examiner"> During the examination, students should:<br />
      &bull; endeavour to use correct IT terminology<br />
      &bull; discuss all options when asked to justify a choice or compare one option to another<br />
      &bull; know how to respond to key instructional terms in questions, such as 'state', 'explain', 'justify' or 'describe'<br />
      &bull; reread each question and their response to ensure the question has been answered<br />
      &bull; avoid using pencil in Sections B and C as responses in pencil can often be difficult for assessors to read<br />
      &bull; read the case study and questions carefully and underline or highlight key words<br />
      &bull; endeavour to demonstrate their knowledge of the subject and apply that knowledge to the case study, as<br />
    generic responses often result in low or no marks.</p></td>

A. logic error.<br />
B. syntax error.<br />
C. run time error.<br />
D. compile time error.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Answer is A.</p>
<p class="myanswer">A<em> logic error</em> is when the code can be interpreted by the compiler, but the algorithm behind the calculation is wrong.<br />
<em>Syntax errors</em> occur when the code cannot be interpreted by the compiler (e.g. an unknown command is used, or the punctuation is not what the compiler expected).<br />
<em>Run time errors</em> occur when a situation arises during program execution that causes a fatal error, such as an unhandled division by zero or running out of memory.<br />
A <em>compile time</em> error (I'm guessing) is an obscure error type which would usually be a synonym for syntax error. Maybe an expected library can't be found or something? </p>

A. design<br />

<p class="myanswer">If the data had come from an old system, it could well have been under analysis (B) before work began on modifying it.<br />
You would not be designing a system that's already in use and producing data. You might look at data from an <strong>old</strong> system if you're modifying it.<br />
Implementation does not require such data to be collected.<br />
Since the system is in place, one would collect this data to see whether the system is meeting its expectations: evaluation.

<p>  Threats to computer systems come in many forms.<br />
a.&nbsp; Explain the key difference between the way viruses and trojans get into a computer system.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Viruses enter a system attached to other files (not email attachments, virus code is injected into host files, particularly executable files and travels inside the host.)</p>
<p class="myanswer">Trojans are self-contained malware that are usually downloaded and opened by users who are deceived or tricked into thinking it is something good. </p>
<p>2 marks</p>
<p class="examiner">While viruses come attached to emails, files and programs, and install themselves into computer systems, a user installs a trojan by installing the program containing the trojan. The following is an example of a high-scoring response. <em>Trojans usually appear as something positive like an email from a friend, but when the email is opened the Trojan software is installed on your computer. Viruses may be received through infected USBs, going onto certain bad websites are installed automatically into your machine usually without your knowledge.</em></p>
<p>  b.&nbsp; Explain the key difference between the purpose of spyware and the purpose of viruses.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Spyware is designed to monitor a system and its users and return information to the spyware's controller. Monitoring can include keystrokes, including passwords and bank account data (via keyloggers), websites visited, work rate etc.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Viruses have a variety of purposes including causing data loss, annoying people, showing off, or just getting their virus to propagate widely. Viruses yield no real or direct benefit to their authors.</p>
<p>2 marks</p>
<p class="examiner">The purpose of a virus is to copy itself to as many other computers as possible and to generally cause disruptions.<br />

The following is an example of a high-scoring response.<br />
<em>Spyware &ndash; designed to spy on the actions on the computer of the user and send this data back to the creator of the code. Viruses<br />
are designed to destroy data and in the process destroy the system (destructive code) through malicious code.</em></p>

Country hospitals are finding it difficult to employ specialist doctors. To deal with the problems caused by this, it was suggested that doctors in country hospitals be put in touch with specialists in Melbourne via the Internet. The government decided to set up a project to create the suggested system naming it RuraLink.<br />
Percy Farmer has been hired to manage the RuraLink system. He was told that RuraLink must allow</p>
<div align="left">
<ul>
<li> the specialists in Melbourne to obtain medical data about patients directly from equipment, such as heart-rate monitors, X-ray machines, ultrasound scanners and video cameras</li>
<li>the specialists to access patient records in the country hospital databases</li>
<li>doctors and nurses at the country hospitals to send any measurements or observations they make; for example patients' weight or a description of injuries</li>
<li>the specialists in Melbourne to provide immediate advice to the country hospital doctors and nurses.</li>
</ul>

<p align="left"><img src="/m/pm/10s-cs1.jpg" width="631" height="289" alt="figure 1" /></p>
<p align="left">After some investigation Percy found that all country hospitals have a computer-based administration system. These systems are usually small local area networks with workstations located in the administration area, at each ward desk, and in the emergency department, as shown in Figure 2. To keep costs to a minimum Percy has decided that RuraLink should use as much of the existing country hospital's system as possible.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="/m/pm/10s-cs2.jpg" width="591" height="334" alt="figure 2" /></p>
<p align="left">Percy's investigations have also found that it would be better if the equipment came to the patients rather than having the patients moved to the equipment. He drew a diagram showing how a 'telemedicine' trolley might be used to bring the equipment to the patients. It is shown in Figure 3.</p>

<p align="left"> One of RuraLink's specifications is that a specialist in Melbourne can access patient records stored in a country hospital's database. Patients, however, may have data about them stored at more than one hospital. So that RuraLink can provide data to the specialist from any hospital database, the patients' Medicare numbers will be used as a link between databases.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="left"><img src="/m/pm/10s-c4.jpg" width="237" height="149" alt="medicare card" /></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Percy is writing the program specification. For the section dealing with entry of the Medicare number he writes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>  If the user makes a mistake entering the Medicare number, the program has to provide as much information as possible about what is wrong. Therefore include these validation tests.<br />
<strong>Length</strong> - to make sure that the correct number of characters has been entered<br />
<strong>Existence</strong> - to make sure that the number entered exists on Medicare's database<br />
<strong>Null</strong> - to make sure something has been entered<br />
<strong>Type</strong> - to make sure that only numeric characters have been entered</p>
<p>Note: These tests must be performed in the most effective order.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>a. Place these validation tests in the most effective order.</p>
<p class="myanswer">SEE BELOW</p>
<p>1 mark - state average 0.8</p>
<p align="left" class="myanswer"><em>I've started getting a bee in my bonnet (or a terrier in my trousers) about this question.<br />
<br />
Hmm. What is "effective" about the order? It must relate to <strong>how well</strong> it does the job of finding invalid numbers.<br />
<br />
But if <strong>all 4 tests</strong> are going to be conducted, any order of the 4 tests will yield <strong>exactly the same</strong> results.<br />
<br />
It might be different if we wanted to find invalid numbers <strong>soonest,</strong> or with the <strong>minimum number of tests</strong>, but they are <strong>efficiency</strong> criteria, not effectiveness.<br />
<br />
I'm seriously starting to believe that this is a Bull Mastiff of a question... All orders must be equally effective.<br />
<br />
I can usually work out what the examiners were probably trying to get at, but this one has me completely baffled (like <a href="/p/postmortem-2010i.htm#Q3">multichoice Q3 on the ITA paper</a>).&nbsp; I have no idea whatsoever of what knowledge the examiners are hoping I will show.<br />
<br clear="all" />
So, can anyone please tell me:<br />
<br />
1. how one order can be more effective than another.<br />
2. what order is most effective, and why the reverse order would be less effective!<br />
<br />
Growl.</em></p>
<p align="left" class="examiner">Either of: <br />
&bull; Null, Length, Type, Existence <br />
&bull; Null, Type, Length, Existence. <br />
Students were generally able to put the validations tests listed in an appropriate order.</p>
<p>b. Give three reasons why this order is the most effective way of doing these validation tests.</p>

<p>Reason 2</p>
<p>Reason 3</p>
<p>3 marks - average 1.9</p>
<p align="left" class="examiner">Some students had difficulty giving reasons why their nominated order was the most effective. Students were expected  to have knowledge of validation techniques, including existence checking, range checking and type checking for Unit 4, 
Outcome 1.<br />
The following is an example of a high-scoring response.<br />
<em>Reason 1 A Null test must come first, as none of the other test can be done if nothing has been entered.<br />
Reason 2 The Existence test should come last, as the input will not be in the database if it has failed the previous tests.<br />
Reason 3 The Length test should come before the type test, as it requires less processing to check and inputs length.</em></p>

<p class="myanswer">2 December 2010 - VCAA responded to my complaint about the question:</p>
<p class="myanswer">&quot;In relation to VCE IT: Software Development, Section C Question 4 the Panel Chair and Chief Assessor have provided the following information:</p>
<p class="myanswer">This question is about a validation strategy based on the program specification. The definition of effectiveness in the Study Design is 'a measure of how well something works'. The definition also continues with 'measures of an effective information system'; one of these is given as 'communication of message'. This relates to the question where it talks about the user ... and the program has to provide as much information as possible about what is wrong. The most effective way of providing this is therefore null first, existence last. You have assumed that all four tests are going to be conducted. The statement in the question 'therefore include these validation tests' cannot be interpreted as 'these tests must be run on every number'. These tests are included in the program - perhaps using 'if statements in such a way that the most effective message is returned - therefore, the question 'place the validation tests in the most effective order'. &quot;</p>

<p>Feature 1 </p>
<p class="myanswer">Ethernet connection</p>
<p>Explanation </p>
<p class="myanswer">Since communication is the most important feature, Ethernet connectivity is vital so the device can connect to the LAN to exchange data.</p>
<p>Feature 2 </p>
<p class="myanswer">Weight</p>
<p>Explanation</p>
<p class="myanswer">Since it must be portable, the ease of handling its weight is the next most vital feature of a portable computing device.</p>
<p>Feature 3 </p>
<p class="myanswer"><em>After covering Ethernet and weight, any of these can appear in third spot...</em></p>
<ul>
<li class="myanswer">screen size - the bigger the screen, the more data can be viewed at a legible size</li>
<li class="myanswer">touch screen - when mobile and hand-help, touch screens are easier to use that little keyboards.</li>
<li class="myanswer">battery life - being portable, it must run on batteries. Long battery life is a distinct advantage.</li>
</ul>
<p class="myanswer"><em>These would be harder to justify. You might disagree.</em></p>
<ul>
<li class="myanswer">keypad - not really a vital feature unless it was the only data input method.</li>
<li class="myanswer">storage capacity - the device will be uploading to the trolley, so it will not need to store a huge amount of data for very long.</li>
<li class="myanswer">stylus - a pretty trivial point nowadays</li>
<li class="myanswer">USB connection - not vital unless super-fast upload speed is needed. It perhaps could be used to recharge the device's battery.</li>
</ul>
<p>3 marks - average 2.3</p>
<p class="examiner">The most appropriate features were battery life, screen size and weight; however, students could have selected other features as long as they were also able to explain why the feature was essential. <strong>Ethernet connection was not appropriate as the question asked for items other than methods of communication.</strong> Many students were able to provide appropriate responses.</p>
<p><span class="comment">8 Sept 2011 - But the question did NOT ask for items other than methods of communication!&nbsp; <br />

<p class="myanswer">The amount of time taken to arrive at an accurate diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>How this data would be used to evaluate the achievement of the goal </p>
<p class="myanswer">If the system helps local doctors get a quicker diagnosis and treatment regime from the city specialists, and dangerous complications and secondary illnesses are prevented, then the system is achieving its goals.</p>
<p>4 marks - average 1.5</p>
<p class="examiner">Appropriate comments could have included: <br />
&bull; the average time taken to gain access to a specialist in that medical area &ndash; this could be compared to previous lengths of time it took to access the specialists. If the length of time has decreased, patient outcomes have improved <br />
&bull; the time between the presentation of symptoms, diagnosis and treatment &ndash; could be compared to previous lengths of time <br />
&bull; the number of patients with positive outcomes &ndash; if fewer patients are dying, then the patient outcomes have improved. </p>
<p class="examiner">Students struggled with this evaluation question and it was clear that most students had limited knowledge about how to provide an appropriately detailed response. Many students left this question blank; however, students should be encouraged to provide a response to all questions even if they are unsure of the correct response. The key with most evaluations strategies is that data from a previous system is compared with current details, so data collected must be measurable and allow a comparison.</p>
<p>Total 53 marks - <span class="comment">from now on the total for section C will be 60.</span></p>

<p class="myanswer"><em>On the whole, a slightly easy paper. Some of the options to choose from were absurdly easy to rule out: they could have been more challenging.</em></p>
<p class="myanswer"><em>There's not as much actual <strong>coding</strong> as I'd expect from a course called &quot;Software Development&quot;. That always bemuses me: lots of questions on peripheral matters, and not much on <strong>core </strong>programming business.</em> <em>It's the price you pay for creating an academic programming course, I guess.</em></p>
<p class="myanswer"><em>The case study could have had more information to clarify the external entities. </em></p>
<p class="myanswer"><em>A few questions were creatively formulated, and reached just the right level of difficulty.</em></p>
<p class="myanswer"><em>Question 4 in section C is a mad dog beast that escaped its cage at VCAA and should have been shot in the head by Atticus Finch as it lurched down Spring Street, slavering and howling its nonsense. My 2c worth </em>:-)<em><br />
