     <p class="myanswer">Answer is D.</p>
     <p class="myanswer">Pseudocode is a relaxed, language-independent representation of an algorithm. Internal documentation are the non-executable comments and remarks inserted into source code for reference by programmers. It may also refer to other things that make code more understandable, such as line indentation and meaningful object naming. In compiled programs, comments are ignored by the compiler so they add no size to an executable program.</p>

 <p align="left">Annalie asks a programmer, Sam, to help her code a program. She suggests that 50 per cent of code lines be internal documentation as that is her company's normal practice. Sam says that adding internal documentation is a waste of time and he can work much faster if he just leaves out all internal documentation.</p>
 <p align="left">a. Outline two reasons to support Annalie's suggestion of adding internal documentation.&nbsp;2 marks </p>
 <p>Reason 1 [4 lines] </p>
 <p class="myanswer">It makes the meaning and purpose of the code clear to programmers. Code tends to be terse and its operation unclear. Adding remarks explains what the code is meant to do. Using code indentation and good object naming (other forms of internal documentation) makes code more readable and self-explanatory.</p>
 <p>Reason 2 [4 lines]</p>
 <p class="myanswer">It makes the code easier to maintain in future. Trying to understand someone else's code (or even your own code) after time has elapsed can take a lot of study without the explanations offered by internal documentation.</p>
 <p class="myanswer"> <span class="examiner">Most students were able to provide two reasons to support the addition of internal documentation,<br />
   with many mentioning that this assists with readability and maintainability.<br />
   The following is an example of a high-scoring response.<br />
   <em>Internal documentation will aid the company in the future in maintaining or repairing the code,</em><br />
   <em>as whoever is reading and editing it can understand its purpose.</em><br />
   <em>Internal documentation is beneficial as it provides meaningful comments which may help</em><br />
   <em>Annalie understand Sam&rsquo;s code. As they are both working on the project together, this is</em><br />
   <em>necessary</em>. AVERAGE MARK 1.4</span><br />
 </p>
 <p>b. Describe <strong>one</strong> naming convention that you have used in programming. Explain how this convention makes programming better. Give an example to support your answer. 3 marks [6 lines]</p>
 <p class="myanswer">Hungarian Notation - the use of a prefix to identify the type of object, such as intLength for an integer or lblName for a label. The prefix ensures each object is treated appropriately, and you don't try to store decimal places in an integer, or forget that 'Name' is a label rather that a textbox and try to set properties that don't exist for that class of object.</p>
 <p class="comment">or</p>
 <p class="myanswer">CamelCase - since one can't use spaces in object names, using capital letters for the initial letter of each words in an object's name makes it easier to identify the different words in the name. e.g. 'TimeOfArrival' is easier to read than 'timeofarrival'.</p>
 <p> <span class="examiner">Although students had an understanding of naming conventions many did not fully answer the<br />
   question. The question contained three instructional terms &lsquo;describe&rsquo;, &lsquo;explain&rsquo; and &lsquo;give (an<br />
   example)&rsquo; and each of these parts needed to be addressed. However, often students only<br />
   answered one part or two parts of the question, with many not providing examples.<br />
   The following is an example of a high-scoring response.<br />
   <em>One naming notation is Hungarian notation such as &lsquo;btnExit&rsquo;, in which the first letters are what</em><br />
   <em>the object is, such as button (btn) or textbox(txt) and the second half describes the purpose of</em><br />
   <em>the it. For example, in btnExit, the &lsquo;Exit&rsquo; is the purpose of the button. This makes programming</em><br />
   <em>better as the developers will be able to understand what the object is and its purpose, so they</em><br />
   <em>can code it more efficiently and will less errors.</em> AVERAGE MARK 1.6.</span></p>

<p class="comment">A pretty basic and repetitive UCD task, IMO. <br />
  For added value, I added the arrow heads to show that the actors could initiate the logins.<br />
  The pathologist actor was awkwardly placed. It should have been on the other side with the patient.
  <br />
  How is this going to be marked?  <strong>Four</strong> marks are given for only <strong>three</strong> association lines? <br />
  Why can medical information be accessed willy-nilly without any security?
  <br />
  Have I missed something?</p>
<p class="comment"><img src="/m/pm/15s-b02sol2.gif" width="658" height="390" alt="" /></p>
<p class="comment">Yes.<br />
  The scenario was not realistic. <br />
  Why could people access sensitive medical data without needing to login?<br />
  It makes sense to make all 4 of the the data accesses <strong>always</strong> requires logged in first (using &lt;&lt;includes&gt;&gt;).<br />
  That also neatly solves the inconvenient placement of the pathologist actor.<br />
  It also explains the 4 marks for 4 association lines.
</p>
<p class="comment">Thanks to Brody for the prompt!</p>
<p class="comment">Then a third possibility comes to mind too. Since the pathologist will firstly analyse (requiring the login) and <strong>then</strong> store, the 'store results' use case could be shown as an includes as well. </p>
<p class="comment">Fourth possibility is that the 'store results' use case is an &lt;&lt;extends&gt;&gt; if the pathologist did not always store the results of the analysis.</p>
<p class="comment">But in either case, the association line from pathologist to the 'store results' use case would need to be removed, and it's all getting rather too complex, and the assigned number of marks doesn't make sense again.</p>

<p>a. The total mark for each test is 30. No half-marks are awarded. <br />
 What was Olivia's test score for the third test? 1 mark [1 line]</p>
<p class="myanswer">28.</p>
<p class="comment">You mean - that's IT? 
  That's all? Just effectively <strong>read a table</strong>?<br />
  It hardly takes a year of study to work that one out.</p>
<p class="comment">And why was it necessary to point out &quot;The total mark for each test is 30. No half-marks are awarded.&quot;<br />
  It's completely irrelevant to any question asked! It seems like the examiner planned to use it to ask other questions (e.g. the array's data type), then didn't.
</p>
<p class="examiner">The correct response was 28. AVERAGE MARK 1.</p>
<p>b. The lowest test score is 14. <br />

<p>c. To find the total of the four test scores of a student, would Sue write a procedure to find the sum of each column or the sum of each row? 1 mark [1 line]</p>

<p class="myanswer"> <span class="examiner">Most students were able to identify that the sum of each row was required to perform the<br />
  calculation described. AVERAGE MARK 0.8.</span><br />
</p>
<p>d. State <strong>two</strong> reasons why Sue has used a two-dimensional array instead of four one-dimensional arrays to store the test scores. 2 marks [4 lines]</p>

<p class="myanswer">1. Using 4 arrays, she would have had to repeat code four times to manipulate each test. This is a lot of unnecessary coding that would only make the software bigger and slower - and no better.</p>
<p class="myanswer">2. Using one array means she can quickly and easily use nested loops to process all students and all tests in one operation. She could loop  vertically to add all students' test results and then generate a class average for each test, or horizontally add values to get each student's total or average over all four tests.</p>
<p class="comment">This would have been a chance to get students to write pseudocode to actually create a test average for each student.<br />
  You can do it anyway, just for the exercise.
</p>
<p class="examiner"> A number of possible reasons were accepted; however, more commonly students identified that it<br />
  was easier to add scores and more efficient (easier) programming.<br />
  The following is an example of a high-scoring response.<br />
  <em>An individual separate test scores can be easily referenced or summed.</em><br />
  <em>All the data is found within one structure making it easier to manage the code.</em> AVERAGE MARK 0.6</p>

 <p align="left">Maintainability [5 lines]</p>
<p class="myanswer">If the error rate reported in the log increases over time, it's a sign that the system is hard to maintain and is becoming increasingly error-prone.

 <p class="comment"> <span class="examiner">Students answered this question with varying degrees of success. It was important for students to<br />
   explain how error logs could measure the reliability and maintainability of a network; for example,<br />

   unreliable.<br />
   The following is an example of a high-scoring response.<br />

 <p align="left">CASE STUDY INSERT FOR SECTION C<br />
 Please remove from the centre of this book during reading time. </p>
 <p><strong>Case study</strong></p>
 <p class="question">Case study<br />
 A large regional city council is due to elect new council members. The city council covers an area of 
 20000 square kilometres and has a population of 50000. The council members are elected by council 
 residents and property owners who are legally able to vote. The council maintains an electronic roll of all 
 eligible voters (voters' electoral roll). This year, the council has decided to use electronic voting to collect 
 and count the votes.</p>
 <p class="question"> The current proposal is to use specially designed desktop computers (voting machines) connected to a server 
 at each polling booth. Each of the servers will be linked to the main server at the council's office. When 
 voters cast their votes, the data will be uploaded to the local file server at the polling booth. A file of voters 
 who have voted will be created and a separate file containing the actual votes, stripped of any identification, 
 will also be created. These files will then be transmitted to the local council records, where they will be 
 stored on the main server as part of the council's computer system.</p>
 <p class="question"> All voters who cannot attend on Election Day will be required to vote earlier at the council's office or request 
 access to the mobile voting service, if they meet certain eligibility criteria. The mobile voting service will 
 be available to voters who live within the council's boundaries and are at least 80 years of age or have a 
 diagnosed medical condition that may prevent them from travelling to a polling booth. A mobile device will 
 be brought to eligible voters so that they can cast their vote. The mobile device will be connected wirelessly 
 to the main server at the council's office.</p>
 <p class="question"> The proposed voting system will operate two weeks prior to, and on, Election Day. Voters who need to vote 
 before Election Day will be required to come into the council's office during this period to cast their votes. 
 The mobile service will be available only on application.</p>
 <p class="question"><img src="/m/pm/15s-cs01.gif" width="616" height="501" alt="" /></p>
 <ul>
   <li>The electronic voting system is expected to have the following advantages:</li>
   <li>     It substantially reduces invalid votes.</li>
   <li>It allows for election results to be known	earlier.</li>
   <li>It eliminates the need to employ staff to count votes.</li>
   <li>It reduces postal voting.</li>
   <li>It is accessible to those with disabilities.</li>
   <li>It reduces the possibility of human manipulation of the results.</li>

 <p>The council has appointed the company Marvellous Management Systems (MMS) to produce the voting software. The council has provided the information in the case study insert and has asked MMS for the software requirements specifications (SRS) document as soon as possible.<br />
 Explain the purpose of the SRS document. [5 lines]</p>
<p align="left" class="myanswer">An SRS documents the scope, constraints and requirements of the new software, and is used to guide the design, development and evaluation of the system.</p>
<p align="left"> <span class="examiner">The study design indicates that the &lsquo;software requirements specifications fulfils the purposes of<br />
  breaking down the problem into component parts, providing input to the designing stage and<br />
  serving as a reference point for further stages of the problem-solving methodology&rsquo;. &lsquo;It documents<br />
  the key tasks associated with the analysing stage of the problem-solving methodology. The<br />
  software requirements specifications (SRS) fully describes the functional requirements (what it is<br />
  required to do) and non-functional requirements of the solution (solution attributes)&hellip; the<br />
  conditions affecting the solution (constraints) and the parameters of the solution (scope).&rsquo;<br />
  Students responded with varying levels of knowledge, from very vague comments (&lsquo;documents<br />
  what the solution will be like&rsquo;) to clear and detailed responses. Students were expected to show<br />
  depth of understanding in their response.<br />
  The following is an example of a high-scoring response.<br />
  <em>The SRS is written after the proposed solution has been analysed and contains the solution</em><br />
  <em>requirements, the scope, constraints and its intended operating environment. The purpose of</em><br />

 <p>Sally, as the manager of the voting software for MMS, is beginning to write the SRS document.<br />
 Provide two important non-functional requirements relevant to this voting software for Sally's SRS and explain why each is relevant to the software.<br />
 </p>
 <p>Requirement 1 [1 line] - <span class="myanswer">It must be able to work on a mobile device.</span></p>
 <p>   Explanation [2 lines] - <span class="myanswer">Voters who can't attend on Election Day will be visited at their home so they can cast their vote. This will only work if the software can be run on a mobile device.</span></p>
 <p>   Requirement 2 [1 line] - <span class="myanswer">It must work quickly.</span></p>

 <p class="myanswer">Also:</p>
 <ul>
   <li class="myanswer">It needs to be usable by people with disabilities - such as the elderly or people with diagnosed disorders.</li>
   <li class="myanswer">It needs to be secure, to reduce the possibility of human manipulation of the election results.</li>

 <p> <span class="examiner">A number of non-functional requirements could have been discussed in response to this question;<br />
   however, the most common responses were user friendliness/ease of use and reliability. It was not<br />
   appropriate in this scenario to discuss maintainability.<br />
   The following are examples of high-scoring responses.<br />
   <em>Ease of use &ndash; with so many voters of different ages and levels of technical ability, the system</em><br />
   <em>must be easy to understand, navigate and use.</em><br />
   <em>User friendliness of the voting system- as thousands of residents will be voting (many of which</em><br />
   <em>may be inexperienced with IT) voting needs to be a quick and simple process to avoid large</em><br />
   <em>queues and waiting times.</em><br />
   <em>The voting software must be 100% reliable &ndash; the software store the voters add their votes for</em><br />
   <em>transfer to the main server and must be able to operate with not breakdowns or all the important</em><br />
   <em>data will be lost and must be recollected</em>. AVERAGE MARK 1.9</span></p>

 <p>The council wants to offer mobile voting to voters aged 80 and above or those who may be unable to get to the polling booth due to a diagnosed medical condition. To obtain an estimate of how many voters will require mobile voting, Sally has decided to use the council's electronic roll of eligible voters. She will create a file containing each voter's name, address, age and information on whether they have a diagnosed medical condition. The following algorithm is suggested, with Age being the age of the person in years and Medical indicating if they have a diagnosed medical condition. </p>

 <p>A member of Sally's team has suggested using a virtual private network (VPN) for sending the voting data back to the council.<br />
 Explain <strong>two</strong> advantages for the council of using a VPN rather than the internet using HTTP or HTTPS. [9 lines]</p>
 
 <p class="myanswer">Communications over a  VPN are very securely encrypted, so data will be safe during transit. <br />
   A VPN is obviously better than HTTP, which is not encrypted at all, and is very insecure since it's easy to intercept and read packets as they travel.<br />
   HTTPS is encrypted with public key encryption (SSL or TLS) which offer good protection (but there have been recent cases of security holes in some SSL libraries.) <br />
   Also, SSL happens at layer 7 of the OSI model, and most VPNs work at the network layer (3), which means it protects data from bad guys on the internet earlier than SSL does. But remember: not even VPN is guaranteed 100% secure. No software ever will be.</p>
 <p class="comment">What's a <strong><em>second</em></strong> advantage of VPN? <br />
   Is it quicker to type &quot;VPN&quot; than &quot;HTTPS&quot;? <br />
   Does it sound more impressive if you say you have a VPN?</p>
 <p class="comment">This is quite a technical question - especially the difference between HTTPS and VPN. 
   <br />
   It's a bit too rough on most students, I'd say.<br />
   I predict that most students will score badly on this question.
 </p>
 <p class="comment"> <span class="examiner">Most students had difficulty with providing technically accurate information or responses were<br />
   generic statements without depth. The question required a response that addressed the<br />
   advantages to the council, not just the advantages of a VPN. There was also an expectation that<br />
   students considered the advantages when compared to HTTP or HTTPS. One key advantage<br />
   being the encryption provided between the polling booth and the council, which was essential for<br />
   security of data as well as privacy of voting information.<br />
   The following is an example of a high-scoring response.<br />
   <em>One advantage of the VPN will be that it will not require the council to build any new</em><br />
   <em>infrastructure to facilitate the sending of data as a VPN will utilise already made networks. A</em><br />
   <em>VPN will also be more secure than internet using HTTP or HTTPS. One reason for this is that a</em><br />
   <em>VPN will require users to login with a username and password, which only approved council</em><br />
   <em>workers will possess. The data will also be encrypted in a VPN so that if it is intercepted it still</em><br />
   <em>cannot be read, and is therefore more secure than a standard HTTP or HTTPS.</em> </span></p>

 <p>If this voting software is successful, it is hoped that the software will be sold and used in other larger elections. As such, it may need to allow for electoral rolls of approximately 10 million voters. Each voter's record is approximately 150 bytes.</p>

 <p class="myanswer">Yes. The file can be stored on the device because 1.5 GB is less than 32 GB.</p>

 </p>
 <p>b. If the mobile device has 512 megabytes of RAM, what effect is using this file likely to have on processing?
 1 mark [3 lines]</p>
 <p class="myanswer">Processing will be slower. Because the entire data file will not be able to be stored completely in RAM, it will need to be swapped in and out to secondary storage (e.g. SD card) as needed. Accessing these non-volatile media is slower than accessing RAM, so processing will be considerably slower.</p>
 <p class="explanation">The same happens with a home PC with little RAM that has to use the page file on hard disk to simulate RAM.</p>
 <p class="examiner"> The majority of students were able to identify that the whole file cannot be held in RAM at the same<br />
   time, so processing will be slower as the records will need to be read each time they are required<br />
   from storage and not just from the faster RAM. This meant that more time would be required for<br />
   this reading and writing back to stored file each time.<br />
