Describe the differences between a bus, a star and a hybrid network topology. (6 lines) 
3 marks. <span class="red">State average=2 </span></p>
<p class="myanswer">Bus is based on a single backbone cable from which branch nodes. A break anywhere in the bus causes failure of the segment. It is usually found in old coaxial-cable networks. </p>
<p class="myanswer">Star has a central distribution device, usually a switch, from which cables radiate to nodes. </p>
<p class="myanswer">Hybrid is simply a combination of more than 1 topology, such as bus and star combined - often called a tree topology. </p>
<p class="examiner">&bull; Bus: All nodes connecting computers and other devices are on the same cable (backbone). If one node fails everything after that will not work. <br />
&bull; Star: Each computer/device is connected by its own cable that connects directly to a central distribution device (for example, a switch). If one fails it does not affect others. <br />
&bull; Hybrid: A combination of two or more of the above structures (it can be two stars joined, or one star with one bus, etc.). <br />
This was a straightforward question, so it was disappointing that less than half of the students completed it. A significant number of students could not provide a description of any of the topologies listed. The topology most often not attempted was hybrid. These topologies are listed in the glossary of the study design and should form part of the content covered in the course.</p>

<p> b. Describe one problem that Robert may have using CDs as his only photo storage solution. 
2 marks. 6 lines.<span class="red"> State average=1.5</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="myanswer">He'd need a lot of CDs (about 94 a year) making searching for pictures a pain.</li>
<li class="myanswer">If a CD were scratched or lost, he'd lose his only copy of the images. </li>
<li class="myanswer">CDs tend to degrade over time. After a while, there might be big data loss. </li>
<li><span class="myanswer">Not too far in the future, he might not be able to read CDs because technology left them behind like 5.25&quot; floppy disks.</span><br />
</li>
</ul> 
<p class="examiner">Students needed to describe a problem that may occur if only CDs are used as a storage solution. For example, using CDs as the only storage solution is high risk, because if a CD was lost there would be no back up. In addition, Robert would need an excessive number of CDs to store all the images, and locating a file would be difficult. A majority of students were able to provide an appropriate response to this question. Those who did not receive full marks had generally misread the question.</p>
<p>c. Describe and justify a better solution for Robert to use to store his pictures and keep them safe. 
3 marks. <span class="red"> State average=1.7</span></p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> <span class="myanswer">He'd want at least 2 copies of the pictures, preferably on different media types. A large (terabyte-sized) external USB hard disk plus identical copies on DVDs (which share some of the problems of CDs, but have much greater capacity.) </span><br />
<strong>Justification:</strong> <span class="myanswer">The second device would reduce the chances of him losing everything with one technical failure, and using a hard disk means huge, portable, very fast storage and retrieval.  </span></p>
<p class="comment">If the exam book does not offer &quot;prompts&quot; for multi-part questions (1. Describe, 2. Justify), you can use your own subheadings to make it clear what you are talking about. It also reminds you to discuss each part! </p>
<p class="examiner">As this question was asking students to describe an appropriate storage/backup strategy, they needed to describe and justify a number of steps when formulating a strategy. For example, use two different media, such as DVD and an external hard disk, as they are relatively cheap and have a higher capacity then CDs. Store backups in different locations to the ensure safety of the original pictures. This question was poorly done. Many students did not pick up the key point that Robert had only one storage solution, which meant that they needed to provide two alternative storage media as a key part of their response.</p>

<p><strong>Question 4</strong><br />
Hungarian notation is a naming convention for program elements such as variables and objects. The convention is that the first two or three letters of the element's name indicate the type of element. The rest of the name indicates its purpose, and starts with a capital letter; for example a text box containing a first name could be called <strong>txtFname</strong>. State <strong>three</strong> benefits of this method of naming. 
3 marks, 8 lines <span class="red"> State average=0.95</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="myanswer">The variable type can be seen from its name</li>
<li class="myanswer">It reminds the programmer of the type of each variable or object so it is not treated improperly. (e.g. trying to address the .text property of a label in Visual Basic.) </li>
<li class="myanswer">When listing objects, they are grouped by type. ???</li>
<li class="myanswer"> They are independent of a language's inbuilt sigils. e.g. (as Wikipedia informs me) in BASIC, name$ names a string and count% names an integer, and in Perl, $name refers to a scalar value while @namelist refers to a list of values. Using a standard prefix like str, int, sca or lst is less confusing if working with different languages or dialects.</li>
<li class="myanswer">It leads to more consistent variable names</li>
<li class="myanswer">Deciding on a variable name can be a mechanical, and thus quick, process</li>
<li class="myanswer">Inappropriate type casting and operations using incompatible types can be detected easily while reading code</li>
<li class="myanswer">In a weakly-typed language such as Basic, it's easy to create logical errors by mismatching variable types or the properties of objects.</li>
</ul>
<p class="comment">Hungarian notation was invented by Charles Simonyi, who programmed at Xerox PARC (which developed the mouse, GUI and Ethernet amongst other groundbreaking technology) and who later became Chief Architect at Microsoft. He is from Hungary, where - like in Japan - people's surnames precede their given name. He would have been called Simonyi Charles at home. </p>
<p class="examiner">Using appropriate naming conventions for variables and objects: <br />
&bull; allows the programmer to effectively debug <br />
&bull; ensures naming consistency <br />
&bull; ensures easy identification of objects.<br />
Many students did not seem to understand naming conventions within a programming environment, or they had a limited ability to express their knowledge. Many students simply rewrote what was in the question.</p>

<p><strong>Question 5</strong><br />
Mick had been an IT teacher at BN College for 15 years. During this time, he had created and supported their administrative system. Management wanted to sell the system to other schools to earn funds for the school. Mick rejected this idea claiming it would create too much work and would interfere with his teaching. Last year Mick moved to a new school in the new suburb of Melinda. He immediately adapted and installed his administrative system in his new school to the disapproval of the management of BN College. 
Identify and discuss a legal <strong>or</strong> ethical issue involved in this situation.<br />
4 marks, 10 lines <span class="red"> State average=2.0</span></p>
<p class="myanswer">Since Mick produced the system as part of his work, rather than in his own time, the intellectual property rights would belong to his employer since it was &quot;work product&quot; according to the Copyright Act, 1968. If BN College were a government school, the education department would own the rights to the system. If BN College were independent, the college would own the rights to the system. But morally, Mick might claim ownership since he had created it with his own intellectual powers.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Therefore, the government or college could probably <strong>legally</strong> restrict Mick's use of the system elsewhere, but ethically he could make a good case that the system was his 'baby' and only he had the copyright, especially if he came up with the idea on his own and worked on it out of work time, and let the college use it out of goodwill. </p>
<p class="comment">It's a murky issue, and would make many lawyers a lot of money. But you can see the employer's point of view. If you are a games software company and hire a programmer to create a ripper game which earns millions - who should profit from the sales? The programmer, who was paid, or the company who hired him, paid him, and equipped him to do the job? </p>
<p class="comment">Ah, this was interesting, and challenging. Probably <strong>too</strong> challenging from a legal point of view. </p>
<p class="comment">From <a href="http://www.copyright.org.au/pdf/acc/infosheets_pdf/G063.pdf">http://www.copyright.org.au/pdf/acc/infosheets_pdf/G063.pdf</a></p>
<p class="comment">&quot;<strong>Who owns copyright in artistic works?</strong><br />
Generally, if you create an artistic work, you are the first copyright owner. However, there are some important 
exceptions:<br />
&bull; Employees&mdash;if you are an employee and create the work as part of your job, generally your employer owns<br />
the copyright. (This rule does not apply to freelancers, volunteers or people who are commissioned to create<br />
artworks).<br />
&bull; Commissioned material&mdash;special rules apply if you take photographs, make portraits or create engravings,<br />
where someone pays you to make the work for a private or domestic purpose (such as a family portrait or<br />
wedding photograph).<br />
&bull; Work done for governments&mdash;if you create artworks for a State, Territory or Commonwealth government, or a Government is the first publisher of your work, that Government will generally be the copyright owner.&quot;</p>
<p class="examiner">An appropriate answer to a legal issue could have been: If Mick developed this administrative system as part of his work at BN College then the college owns the software and Mick is unable to implement the same system in a second location without the college&rsquo;s permission.<br />
Students needed to demonstrate their knowledge of copyright laws and apply this knowledge to the scenario provided. Many students were not able to express more than a limited understanding of how copyright laws would be applied in this situation. Students need to ensure that they can apply their knowledge of the law, not just recite sections; therefore, teachers should endeavour to provide scenario-based discussions when addressing laws such as copyright.<br />

<h3>Flip Flop Bakery</h3>
<p>Flip Flop Bakery is owned by Sebastian, who is a baker. He employs two assistant bakers, three delivery drivers<br />
and four part-time sales assistants.</p>
<p> Flip Flop Bakery makes bread and bread rolls that it sells to the public through a shop. It also sells its bread, and a range of cakes and pastries that are bought from a wholesale cake supplier, to local restaurants, coffee lounges and clubs.</p>
<p> A typical working day follows this sequence.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sebastian and the assistant bakers arrive at the bakery and start baking at 4.00 am.</li>
<li> All breads and other bread products (bread rolls and so on) are baked by 7.00 am.</li>
<li>The bakers identify any ingredients that are in low supply and inform Sebastian.</li>
<li> The drivers arrive at the bakery and start loading their trucks at 8.00 am.</li>
<li> Cake deliveries arrive at the bakery around 8.00 am.</li>
<li>The bakery drivers deliver their goods and invoices to the customers from 9.00 am.</li>
<li>Drivers handwrite orders from the regular customers and return these to the bakery by 1.00 pm. </li>
<li>Sebastian manually combines the orders and writes a list of the next day's baking requirements.</li>
<li>Sebastian telephones his orders for the necessary ingredients and cakes from his suppliers. Orders must be<br />
placed by 3.00 pm to ensure delivery for the next day's baking.</li>
<li> The bakery closes at 5.00 pm. </li>
</ul>
<h4>The problems</h4>
<p> Sebastian has identified a number of problems that, because of the growth of his business, have now become<br />
critical.<br />
1 When drivers return to the bakery later than 1.00 pm, Sebastian cannot complete the next day's list of baking<br />
requirements.<br />
2 Some drivers have such bad handwriting that Sebastian has trouble reading the orders.<br />
3 Sebastian now spends too much time combining the orders and completing the next day's baking requirements<br />
list.<br />
4 Sometimes Sebastian cannot order extra ingredients on time therefore he cannot bake all of the next day's<br />
bread and so loses orders.</p>
<h4>Proposed system</h4>
<p> To ensure the continued success of his business, Sebastian realises that he must make some changes to his ordering processes. Sebastian's daughter, Kayla, has just completed the first year of a university course in software engineering. She offers to look at how the problems might be solved.<br />
Kayla believes that the only way to improve efficiency is to have a computerised ordering system. There would be a computer at the bakery and the delivery truck drivers would have some kind of mobile device. They would use this to collect and transfer data to the new computer.<br />

<p>Kayla knows that to help Sebastian she must first fully understand the problems, and then analyse the current system.</p>
<p> To start her system analysis, Kayla has drawn the diagram (Figure 1) <strong><a href="#insert">in the case study insert</a></strong>. It shows the movement of goods, invoices and orders associated with Flip Flop Bakery's operation, and the role of the various people involved. She now has to create a logical design for the bakery's information system by drawing a context diagram and data flow diagrams, as well as constructing a data dictionary.</p>
<p><strong>Question 1</strong></p>
<p> Kayla has started the context diagram.</p>

<p>c.	Kayla has based her context diagram on Figure 1. Explain why she has drawn the Bakers as a separate entity. 1 mark, 3 lines<span class="red"> State average=0.36</span></p>
<p class="myanswer">She's just wrong?? </p>
<p class="comment">I have absolutely NO idea. Throw me a bone, someone. If bakers are external entities even though they exist within the data flow of Flip Flop Bakery, why are drivers not <strong>also</strong> external entities?</p>
<p class="comment">Unless the drivers belong in the empty box in the question above... in which case why don't <strong>customers</strong> appear in the DFD?</p>
<p class="comment">I'm confused.</p>
<p>A reliable teacher friend says: </p>
<p class="comment">'They provide data to the 'system' rather than process the data so they would be considered entities rather the part of the system.' </p>
<p class="comment">Ahhh. Everyone - remember that! </p>
<p class="examiner">The Bakers provide data to the system rather than processing the data, therefore they would be considered an entity rather than part of the system. <br />
The use of context and data flow diagrams in the written examination has been relatively consistent over the last few years; therefore teachers and students should have been well prepared for this style of question. However, this question required students to explain their understanding rather than to construct elements of a diagram, which caused problems for a number of students. <br />
Students need to practise constructing context and data flow diagrams and also need to have an understanding of the theory behind the decision making for each element represented. The relevant key knowledge point for this question also requires students to be able to construct data dictionaries .</p>

Kayla has made three attempts to draw a data flow diagram for the processing of customer orders and determining the baking requirements. Consider the accuracy of the DFDs shown below.</p>

<p>a. Identify the <strong>most correct</strong> data flow diagram. 1 mark <span class="red"> State average=0.45</span></p>
<p class="myanswer">DFD <strong>C </strong>&lt;&lt; official VCAA answer. I thought it was A.</p>
<p class="comment">My approach was to find out what all 3 diagrams had in common so I could more easily discover where they differed. So the old highlighter came out. In red I marked all the items that all 3 diagrams shared. The remaining bits were marked in blue... <em>Your strategy might have differed,</em> </p>
<p><img src= "/m/pm/07s-c02a-correct.jpg" width="463" height="554" /></p>
<p class="comment">That helped me focus on the main points where the answer probably lurked. It became immediately obvious that in DFD B, its blue data flow had been discovered before: it was the 'cake flow', not a data flow. So that had to be wrong. </p>
<p class="comment">In DFD A, the odd man out was &quot;Ingredients getting low&quot;. That needed close checking. The case study insert definitely shows the bakers sending a list of ingredients that are getting low to Sebastian, so that looks fair enough.</p>
<p class="comment">DFD C lacks this data flow - but then again there are several data flows missing in all 3 diagrams - invoices coming in from the bread ingredients supplier and cake supplier, and the outgoing orders for ingredients. Whether this was intentional or not is hard to see, but the question clearly asks for the <strong>most correct</strong> DFD... </p>
<p class="comment">So DFD A seemed to be the most correct. <em>A lot of brainwork for 1 mark. Ripoff! :-)</em></p>
<p class="comment">But the thinking spent on 2a also supplies the answers for 2b, so it's not so bad... </p>
<p>b. Explain the main error is in each of the other two data flow diagrams. 2 marks, 3.75 lines each <span class="red"> State average=0.7</span></p>
<p class="myanswer">DFD	<strong>B</strong> is incorrect because the input of &quot;flours, yeast, sugar&quot; is a flow of goods, not data.</p>
<p class="myanswer">DFD	<strong>C</strong> is incorrect because it lacks the &quot;ingredients getting low&quot; data flow from the bakers to 'Process Orders' </p>
<p><span class="red">DFD <strong>A</strong> is incorrect because it has an input &lsquo;low ingredient&rsquo; that is not required to process orders. Also it does not lead to any output.<br />
DFD <strong>B</strong> is incorrect because it shows a data flow that is ingredients (flours, yeast, sugar) rather than data.</span></p>

<p class="comment">Impress your friends at parties: say &quot;a datum&quot; at every opportunity. </p>
<p class="examiner">The inappropriate entry in the data dictionary was 'Calculate quantities needed' as this is a process, not an element of data.<br />
Question 2 required students to interpret elements of a data flow diagram. Part c. asked students to demonstrate their knowledge of a data dictionary, and tested new content in this study design. It is clear that this area may need to be covered in more depth. Teachers should be incorporating this into their System Analysis and Design concepts along side DFD.</p>
<p>Kayla has completed her analysis of the system. She has decided to start the design of the new system with the design of the software. From her analysis she knows that one thing the system has to do is to calculate the required amount of each ingredient.</p>
<p> She designs an algorithm that</p>
<ul>
<li> reads a file to get the total number of different ingredients Sebastian keeps in stock (Num_Ingredients)</li>
<li> for each bread item (Product_ID) ordered, uses recipe data and the number of items ordered (Num _ Ord) to<br />
calculate the amount of each ingredient required for that item (Amount_ Req)</li>
<li> adds the ingredient amounts required for each item to get the total quantity needed for each ingredient<br />
Qty ()</li>
</ul>
<p>The procedure will have passed to it data that lists the amount of each ingredient required for every bread item made by the bakery (Product_Recipes)</p>
<p><br />
Here is Kayla's algorithm.<br />

<p>c. Describe the error in this algorithm (1 mark) <span class="red"> State average=0.1</span></p>
<p class="myanswer">The initialising of Ingredient_ID to 1 in line 12 is wrong because the variable is incremented at the start of the loop, so the starting value is actually 2, not 1. This makes it skip the first ingredient altogether. </p>
<p class="examiner">Ingredient_ID is set to 1 in the first of the nested repeat loops and immediately in the second part of the nested loop it is increased by 1, so the amount of the first ingredient is never calculated. <br />
Students needed to have a full understanding of each of the elements within the algorithm in order to answer this part correctly.</p>

<p> <span class="myanswer"><strong>Ingredient_ID <img src="/m/pm/equals.jpg" width="15" height="13" alt="Equals" /> 0 </strong></span></p>

&bull; move the Ingredient_ID increment line to the end of the loop and change the terminal conditions from UNTIL Ingredient_ID = Num_Ingredients to UNTIL Ingredient_ID &gt; Num_Ingredients <br />
Question 3 challenged students. Only a very small number completed all parts successfully, and over 80 per cent scored no marks for all parts. The algorithm in the question was not overly complicated; however, the use of a two dimensional array may have provided an extra element of difficulty that prevented many students from attempting the question.</p>

<p><strong>Question 5</strong><br />
Kayla and her uncle Michael, an experienced programmer, were discussing the best file structure to use to store the orders for each day. Sebastian has 300 regular customers who have different orders for each day of the week. As well he can have 50 casual orders on any day. Twenty-five per cent of his regular customers alter their daily order from week to week. Kayla suggests using a simple <strong>Serial</strong> Access file while Michael argues that due to the number of changes each day, a <strong>Random</strong> Access file would be best.<br />
For the bakery's application, explain the advantage of the Random file structure for the organisation of this data. (2 marks, 6 lines)<span class="red"> State average=0.5</span></p>
<p class="myanswer">Data would be faster to access, modify, and manage. It would give functionality similar to a database. It would also be far easier to scale up to large sizes compared to a simple, dumb serial file. </p>
<p class="myanswer">A record in a random file can be accessed instantly by its record number, and a record is read as a single cohesive package with a known structure. All the records between the current read position and target position can simply skipped over. </p>
<p class="myanswer">Also, random file is opened for both read and write access. A serial file must be closed and reopened in the desired mode.</p>
<p class="myanswer">A serial file must be completely read and written as a single unit. One can't (for example) open it, change data item 45 and close it again. You'd have to open it in read mode. Read all the data up to item 44 and simultaneously write it to a second file that is opened in write mode. You'd read the target item (#45), change it, write it to the output file, then go on and read every remaining data item and write it to the output file! That's a serious amount of disk activity to modify a single data element! </p>
<p class="myanswer">Serial files are simply a sequential list of data items. To read an item from the list, one must start reading at the start of the file and read every data item up the one you want. If the data consists of groups of related fields (such as the buyer's name, the goods ordered and the quantity), you then have to read the items individually. If the reading gets 'out of sych' so you start reading data in the middle of a 'record' rather than at its beginning, you start getting rubbish data.</p>
<p class="myanswer">The single-unit records in a random file, on the other hand, are read and written as a single object, and the fields in the records can be referred to easily by their field names. e.g. employee.surname (where <strong>employee</strong> is a record and <strong>surname</strong> is a field in the employee record.. </p>
<p class="comment">Yeah - a bit longer than the 6 lines available on the paper, but I added more as an educational freebie. </p>
<p class="examiner">Appropriate responses included the following. <br />
&bull; A Serial Access file would be unsuitable because each new order is written to the end of the file, and finding a required order would be difficult as Sebastian would have to go through each in turn until he found the required order. The same would be true for changing customers&rsquo; orders. However, Random Access files allow Sebastian to locate customer orders efficiently as the files can be added or accessed in any order; this also allows orders to be changed more efficiently. This would be important since many regular customers change their orders with the bakery. &bull; The entire Serial Access file must be read and written each time there is a change, but Random Access files can be searched and only the part that is changed needs to be rewritten. This is important as a large number of daily changes to orders must be made. <br />
Although similar questions have appeared in past examination papers, many students were unable to provide responses that showed their understanding of Random Access files versus Serial Access files<br />

<td><p><strong>Question 6</strong></p>
<p>  As part of the design of the new system, Kayla must decide what kind of mobile device the drivers should use.<br />
She has a choice of the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>  A laptop - this will be used to enter and store orders which will then be uploaded to the bakery's computer<br />
on return.</li>
<li> A Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) - this will be used to enter and immediately transmit orders from the<br />

<p class="comment">Note the bold words &quot;given use&quot;. They don't want you talking about other activities the device could be used for. </p>
<p><strong>Laptop</strong></p>
<p class="myanswer">Advantage 1 - its keyboard is faster and easier to use for data entry </p>
<p class="myanswer">Advantage 2 - its screen is far larger and can display much more data at once </p>
<p><strong>PDA</strong></p>
<p class="myanswer">Advantage 1 - data is transmitted - and can be acted on - as soon as it's received by the driver. There are no delays waiting for the drivers to return to the bakery before Sebastian can phone in his orders by the 3:00 deadline. </p>
<p class="myanswer">Advantage 2- it's small, light and easy for the driver to carry in a pocket</p>
<p class="comment">Others - Its battery would easily last an entire day's operation. </p>
<p><strong>Mobile phone</strong></p>
<p class="myanswer">Advantage 1 - like the PDA, data can be received from drivers before they return to base.*</p>
<p class="myanswer">Advantage 2 - <em>Its battery would easily last an entire day's operation</em>.*</p>
<p class="comment">* Try to avoid repeating the same answer for different sections, even if it's appropriate. Try thinking of something else. <em>But it <strong>is</strong> hard trying to find an advantage of the phone that the PDA does not have. </em></p><em>

<td><p><strong>Question 9</strong><br />
Michael has agreed to help write the programs for the new system. He has advised Kayla that he wants the programs to have good internal documentation: they should contain comment lines and all variables and procedures should have meaningful names. Kayla feels this is a waste of time as she can program much faster with short variable names and no comments. 
Explain why Kayla should follow Michael's advice. 2 marks 7 marks <span class="red"> State average=1.15</span></p>
<p class="myanswer">Meaningful variable names make it easier to remember what variables are used for and help avoid using the wrong variable by mistake. Is is especially useful when you return to your code after some time has passed and you must re-learn your unintuitive names all over again. It is also valuable when other people must maintain your code.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Internal documentation reminds the programmer and co-programmers what the code is meant to do and why things were done as they were. Without such inline documentation it is easy for you or a colleague to change some code without realising the implications of what you were doing. </p>

<strong>Question 14</strong><br />

Kayla has several ideas.</p>
<p> Option 1 - Burn a video onto DVD so they can see what to do<br />
Option 2 - Put help onto Flip Flop's new website<br />
Option 3 - Print a quick guide that covers basic use of the software onto a card that can be put into their 
pocket<br />
Option 4 - Electronic help manual with a search facility stored on the PDA</p>
<p>State which option is the best in this case and justify your answer. 4 marks 9 lines<span class="red"> State average=2.45</span></p>
<p class="myanswer">Overall, Option 2. It depends a lot on how much information you want to give them. For very basic facts, the quick guide would suffice, and be very easily accessible. For comprehensive details, the website might be slow to access, but it can be quickly and easily updated. The help manual would take more time and skill to produce. Since they can't view a DVD on a PDA, option 1 is silly.</p>
