  <td ><p>Examiners' general comments on the 2012 ITA exam (<a href="http://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/Documents/exams/infotech/2012/itapps_assessrep12.pdf">source</a>)</p>
    <p class="examiner">Generally, students who were able to apply their knowledge and understanding to the specific context of a question 
      achieved higher marks than those who provided a more recall-type response. Similarly, students who could draw on
      their practical experiences of using relational database management systems (RDBMS) or spreadsheet software when 
      answering the relevant questions scored well.</p>
    <p class="examiner"> The positive influence of students' familiarity with online communities was very evident in the responses to the social 
      media question (<a href="#b6">Section B, Question 6</a>). Most students were able to develop a coherent argument to support their point 
      of view about the relationship between users' needs and solutions. The responses to this question contained 
      well-thought-out examples of functions and applications that are available on social media websites and their alignment 
      with users' needs. <br />
    </p>
    <p class="examiner">Similarly, many responses indicated that students understood the interpersonal aspects that complicated the ethics of 
      accepting stolen printing credits (<a href="#b8">Section B, Question 8</a>). Many students outlined three or four issues to be considered, 
      stated that there was a need for a systematic response and identified a range of points of view. </p>
    <p class="examiner"> Generally, students could identify the design elements used in a prototype website and explain how these influenced the 
      appearance of the website (<a href="#b7">Section B, Question 7</a>). They could also choose an appropriate design tool to represent the 
      appearance of a website. Less well understood was the influence of design elements on the functionality of a website.       Many students did not annotate the diagram as required. </p>
    <p class="examiner">Finally, teachers are reminded that questions usually ask students to 'state', 'explain', 'discuss' or 'justify' some feature 
      that is described in a scenario and that each of these words is requesting a specific type of response. This is also the case 
      where a 'procedure' or 'strategy' is mentioned in a scenario. It was very pleasing to see that many students understood 
      that each of these words refers to a sequence of processes or set of actions. </p>
    <p class="examiner"><strong>Problem-solving methodology </strong>
      The problem-solving methodology (VCE Information Technology Study Design, pp. 16&ndash;18) is fundamental to the IT 
      Applications study, and it is critical that students have a sound understanding of the purpose of the methodology, the 
      role of each stage and the nature of the activities undertaken in each of these. Generally, students performed poorly on the multiple-choice questions based on this methodology. It is pivotal to every Area of Study and as such will be 
    addressed in a variety of ways in examinations.</p></td>

<p> The manager of a graphic art studio wants to use cloud computing instead of an external hard drive to store image data.<br />

<b>B.</b> name: custPn#, data type: text<br />
<b>C.</b> name: custPhNum, data type: text<br />
<b>D.</b> name: customer phone number, data type: number</p>
<p class="myanswer">Answer is C. Phone numbers have to be text to accommodate the parentheses and leading zero. &lt;B&gt; is not as good because its name is less clear.</p>
<p class="examiner">Option C (name: custPhNum, data type: text) is the most  efficient name and correct data type because 'custPhNum' is 
  more easily and quickly identified by users as the field name 
  for the given phone numbers. A field name 'cusPn#' could be 
  interpreted as a customer PIN field.</p>

<td><p><strong>Question 6</strong></p>
<p> A farmer has hired you to develop a new stock management solution. During development, to ensure that the new solution does what it is intended to do, you should<br />
<b>A.</b> enter a lot of data to make sure the stock numbers are correct.<br />
<b>B.</b> read the quick start guide to make sure it is logical and efficient.<br />
<b>C.</b> create a set of evaluation criteria to judge if the requirements were met.<br />
<b>D.</b> check the system in three to six months to make sure it is working as intended.</p>
<p class="myanswer">It <strong>can't</strong> be &lt;B&gt; because the documentation is irrelevant, and probably won't even exist yet. Reading the QSG does not test if the solution is working properly - it would only test the quality of the QSG!</p>
<p class="myanswer">It <strong>can't</strong> be &lt;C&gt; because the problem solving methodology says that evaluation criteria are determined during design, not development. If this is the answer, the question contradicts the study design and must be declared invalid.</p>
<p class="myanswer">It <strong>can't</strong> be &lt;D&gt; because that's obviously evaluation.</p>
<p class="myanswer">So it has to be &lt;A&gt; <em>but - really - &quot;enter a lot of data&quot;? That is very odd wording. Test data is about quality, not quantity.</em></p>
<p class="myanswer"><em>This question has raised a lot of debate amongst teachers. It's not a good question.</em></p>
<p class="examiner">Option A (enter a lot of data to make sure the stock numbers 
  are correct) occurs during development. Creating a set of 
  evaluation criteria (Option C) occurs during design. Students 
  need to take into account the problem-solving methodology 
  and activities that are performed in each of the four stages.</p>

<td><p><strong>Question 13</strong></p>
<p> A telecommunications company has more than 2000 employees across Australia with 24-hour access to the company intranet. The human resource manager wants to make sure that employees can check their holiday entitlements at any time. 
The most efficient method of achieving this would be to<br />
<b>A.</b> email all employees whenever any entitlements change.<br />
<b>B.</b> upload new entitlement information to the home page on the company intranet.<br />
<b>C.</b> send new entitlement information to the relevant employees' company mobile phones.<br />
<b>D.</b> provide each employee with a written copy of their entitlements whenever there is a change.</p>
<p class="myanswer">My answer is B, but probably shouldn't be. (Spoiler: The official answer is C). <br />
  Email is fast (efficient) so &lt;A&gt; is good. Putting employees' personal information onto the homepage of the intranet violates privacy constraints (but would be efficient!) &lt;C&gt; would probably be quick, but SMSs cost money, which is not efficient. &lt;D&gt; is very slow and expensive.</p>
<p class="examiner">Option C (send new entitlement information to the relevant 
  employees' company mobile phones) is the quickest, easiest 
  and cheapest way for a telecommunications company to 
  communicate the information to the people affected. As all 
  employees have been issued with a mobile phone, direct 
  contact is assumed. Option A relies on relevant employees 
  having access to the internet in order to receive their emails. 
  A home page on an intranet (Option B) is not an appropriate 
  place to store a large amount of personal information and 
  there would not be enough space. Providing a written copy of 
  entitlements (Option D) is not cheap.</p>
<p class="examiner">Only 9% of the state chose C! 66% went for B, 18% for A.<br />

<p class="myanswer">A &quot;complete disaster recovery strategy&quot; is the series of steps taken after a disaster to recover from the disaster. <br />
It is not talking about preparing for disaster. <br />
It is not talking about preparing the strategy itself.</p>

&lt;B&gt; is the only option that refers to recovering data, but practising the procedures is done before, not after the disaster.<br />
Prevention measures are not relevant to disaster recovery, so it's not &lt;C&gt;. <br />
&lt;D&gt; is also about practising. Risk assessment is useful to PREPARE a recovery strategy, but is not done as part of a strategy for recovering from disaster!</p>

  Explanations that gained a second mark included 'allowing users to create links using http' or 'helping users to create 
  web pages that can be viewed or tested'. Students who named less well-known software and explained how it could be 
  used to create a website also received full marks. </p>

<li class="myanswer">modem - to convert digital data to/from analogue data for transmission</li>
<li class="myanswer">router - to route Ethernet packets between the visitor and the webserver</li>
</ul>
<p class="examiner">One mark was allocated to naming a hardware component and one mark for a description of its function. The most 
  common student responses were 'web server' or 'hard disk' as the hardware component. Other accepted answers included any one of Network Interface Cards, modems or routers (network hardware). Acceptable descriptions of the 
  functions for web servers, hard disks and network hardware included 'stores applications', 'stores data files' and 
  'provides communication to the network'.</p>

  data as part of ethical business practice'. Typically, these students argued that the website should be closed and 
  accessed only by registered clients using a login identity and password. Students who argued for an open website and

<li class="myanswer">If files are left open, backup software might not be able to read the files and back them up, leading to potential data loss in case of a data disaster.</li>
</ul>
<p class="examiner">Students had to identify the possible consequences of a user's action. Responses that described possible scenarios and 
  likely consequences for the company's information system received marks. For example, one effect is that anyone else 
  in the office can access at least the network and possibly private client data. This means that the business has not met its 
  legal obligations. Another effect is that incorrect shutdown or power-off can cause data loss because the most recent 
  activity is not saved or client files are corrupted. Another effect is that changes to data might not show up because the 
  intruder is wrongly identified as a legitimate user. As a consequence, the company could lose customer data and not 
  know it has gone or been stolen, or not be able to identify who last accessed a file.</p>

<li class="myanswer">Users want to exchange information with friends, so the site needs to keep track of users' relationships with other users. </li>
<li class="myanswer">Users want privacy so the site needs to password-protect access to personal information and let users specify how much privacy they require.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Users want quick updates and responsiveness so the site must be engineered to update quickly and deliver data without delay.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Users want protection from abuse, so the site needs to set down rules and enforce their observance, and deal with rulebreakers.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Users want to see a lot of really dumb comments being made by uneducated bigots, so the site needs to allow Americans in.</li>
</ul>
<p class="examiner">Students had to identify a social media website and respond to a statement about the relationship between users and the 
  website. The question was very well answered. Most frequently, students identified Facebook and then went on to 
  describe situations in which users' needs had resulted in a range of additional functions being added to the website. For 
  example<br />
  &#61623; chat was originally for communication only between college students, but registration was opened to all when 
  complaints indicated that users found this too restrictive<br />
  &#61623; users wanted to read other people's profiles and share photos, so Facebook has, over time, created a space for 
  personal profiles where you can publicly or privately share photos or post comments on your profile. <br />
  Some students referred to a 'growing democratisation' of the social media website and gave a range of examples to 
  support this claim. For example<br />
  &#61623; it has responded to user criticism of changes to the privacy policy by allowing users to vote on whether <br />
  proposed changes should be implemented <br />
  &#61623; users can choose the level of security they want and speak only to people they know<br />
  &#61623; users can invite new friends to join the conversation <br />
  &#61623; users can track the activity of existing friends.</p>
<p class="examiner">The few students who argued that changes were brought about by commercial needs and who provided a coherent 
  argument with examples to illustrate their claim also received marks.</p>

<td><p> <a name="b7" id="b7"></a>A mock-up for the Southern Bird Spotters organisation's website is shown below. Members of this organisation observe birds in the temperate southern regions of Australia. The organisation wants to encourage members to use a range of online communication features to present and exchange information, and share a collective identity.</p>
<p><img src="/m/pm/12i-B7.jpg" width="642" height="546" alt="Birds" /></p>
<p>a.<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/indent.lbi" -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- #EndLibraryItem --> Select <strong>two</strong> of the following design elements. On the mock-up, show with a label where these elements have been applied. 2 marks</p>
<ul>
<li class="myanswer"><strong>contrast</strong> - the &quot;Sighting of the year&quot;'s white text on grey background<br />
</li>
<li class="myanswer"><strong>orientation</strong> - vertical alignments of the left-hand boxes and right-hand pictures<br />
</li>
<li class="myanswer"><strong>proportion</strong> - the text in the heading is bigger than the other text</li>
</ul>
<p>The examiners' answer annotate the picture in the exam. Arrows pointed to the relevant area...<br />
  &quot;Southern Bird Spotters&quot; logo in map of Australia: <span class="examiner">PROPORTION - larger font for the title.</span><br />

Vaguely under the &quot;This Week&quot; item and left of the &quot;Sighting of the year&quot; item... not really clear what it was pointing at - <span class="examiner">ORIENTATION - caption has horizontal layout.</span></p>
<p class="examiner">The majority of students scored full marks on this question, though some did not annotate the mock-up. Those who 
  correctly labelled any two of the many examples available received full marks. The mock-up above shows examples of 
  correct answers.</p>
<p class="examiner">Average mark was 1.4</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp; Briefly explain how these two design elements have been used to influence the appearance of the website. 2 marks</p>
<ul>
<li class="myanswer"><strong>contrast</strong> - white text on grey stands out from the other black text on white background to make it visually distinctive and prominent</li>
<li class="myanswer"><strong>orientation</strong> - the vertical columns makes the site - umm - neat and attractive?<br />
</li>
<li class="myanswer"><strong>proportion</strong> - the bigger heading text makes it more prominent and easy to find.</li>
</ul>
<p class="examiner">Most students could describe features on the website to illustrate how two of the three design elements were used to 
  enhance the appearance of the website. For example<br />
  &#61623; contrast &ndash; a white or grey background is used with black text or a black background with white text so that 
  images and words stand out and appear more vibrant <br />
  &#61623; orientation &ndash; the shape containing the links is in portrait format because it is a list and the citing of the year is 
  in landscape format because the caption text is on two longer lines<br />
  &#61623; proportion &ndash; font and image sizes have been used to create a hierarchy, where larger elements, such as the title,
  are more important.</p>
<p class="examiner">Average mark was 1.4</p>
<p>c. Select <strong>two</strong> of the following design elements and explain how they have been used to enhance the functionality of the website. 4 marks.<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li class="myanswer"><strong>appropriateness</strong> - the complete lack of nude ladies means male visitors will not be distracted and can concentrate on using the site's functions. Perhaps the copyright statement may also be considered appropriate? It's appropriate that a birdwatcher site has a picture of binoculars? This isn't an easy one...<br />
</li>
<li class="myanswer"><strong>navigation</strong> - the navbar makes it easy to find information on the site.<br />
</li>
<li><span class="myanswer"><strong>relevance</strong> - learning how to upload photos is relevant to the site's purpose, and helps the site gather resources and be more functional.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="examiner">Most students chose to explain how navigation and relevance had been used to enhance the functionality of the website. <br />
  Typical responses include<br />
  &#61623; navigation &ndash; major links are underlined or are in a box on the left; the login link is in a prominent position.  Together, these let members access the login screen and then choose what they want from the link list. <br />
  &#61623; relevance &ndash; images are of birds found in the region shaded in the map or indicated in the club's name. <br />
  This is what the club is about &ndash; birds sighted in the southern parts of Australia.</p>
<p><span class="examiner">  Very few students chose to explain how appropriateness influenced the functionality of the website. Those who did 
  suggested that the club takes birds and knowledge about birds seriously. Typical responses include<br />
  &#61623; the images are all of birds and are of good quality <br />
  &#61623; there is no bad language, no jokes and no images of dead birds. </span></p>
<p><span class="examiner">Average mark was 2.7</span><br />
</p>
<p align="left">d. Discuss the extent to which this website meets the organisation's aim to encourage members to present and exchange information, and share a collective identity. 4 marks</p>
<ul>
<li class="myanswer">The &quot;upload picture&quot; tutorial enables users to present and exchange relevant images. </li>
<li class="myanswer">The &quot;chats&quot; link lets them develop their collective identity by socialising and meeting each other.</li>
<li class="myanswer">The login prevents non-members access features that help define the solidarity and exclusivity of being members.</li>
<li class="myanswer">The calendar can help them plan and participate in collective events.</li>
<li class="myanswer">The blogs let members present information.</li>
<li class="myanswer">The wikis let them collaborate on information gathering.</li>
<li class="myanswer">All of these features taken together would significantly contribute to knowledge sharing and a feeling of community.</li>
</ul>
<p class="examiner">Students were required to address the two aims stated in this question to receive full marks. <br />
  With regard to the first aim, many students identified features that would allow members to share and exchange 
  information. For example <br />
  &#61623; users can share knowledge by clicking on links to blogs, wikis, chats, a photo gallery and an events calendar<br />
  &#61623; members can discuss birds and find out where some species are located <br />
  &#61623; new users can find out how to become members.<br />
  Fewer students were able to address the second aim &ndash; share a collective identity. Typically, appropriate student
  responses referred to members 'identifying with the logo', 'using the image of binoculars' or 'using a map' to 
  encourage a collective identity.</p>

Jack uses these passwords to access the other students' print accounts to print his own assignments on the school network. He has offered to print Ally's assignments. This would save Ally at least $50.</p>
<p align="left">  State an ethical dilemma that Ally might have and discuss what she should consider when resolving this issue. 3 marks</p>
<ul>
<li class="myanswer">If she agrees to Jack's offer, she would benefit from saving money but she would be stealing money from other students, which is unfair to them.</li>
<li class="myanswer">To resolve the issue, she needs to consider the effect on other students if she accepted Jack's offer, compared to the financial benefit to herself. </li>
<li class="myanswer">She should also consider the possibility of Jack and her being punished if they were discovered breaking the rules.</li>
<li class="myanswer">She should consider whether she should try to convince Jack that he should also not access other students' accounts.</li>
<li class="myanswer">She should consider what she would do if Jack continued breaking the rules: she could inform the authorities, but that would raise another dilemma because she would have to balance the wellbeing of her best friend against that of the school and its students. </li>
</ul>
<p align="left" class="examiner">This question was well answered. Many students framed questions that Ally might ask herself. For example<br />
  &#61623; is it fair to use other students' money? <br />
  &#61623; is her loyalty to Jack more important than to other students or to the school? <br />
  &#61623; how would I feel if it was my money that is being used by someone else?<br />
  High-scoring responses typically started with an introductory statement about Ally's problem, identified a likely 
  consequence and recommended an option for action. For example <br />
  &#61623; Ally needs to realise Jack is stealing &hellip; ask herself if the school's reputation will suffer &hellip; she should talk to
  Jack and ask him to stop <br />
  &#61623; Ally needs to decide if her friendship with Jack is more important than &hellip; doing the right thing &hellip; she should 
  help Jack to think about others.</p>

<p>Normalise this data and explain how each normal form (1-3) ensures the integrity of data. Use the space below and over the page. 6 marks</p>

<p><img src="/m/pm/12i-b9.jpg" width="553" height="236" alt="B9" /></p>
<p class="myanswer">To achieve 1NF, I needed to split up multiple data items that were in a single cell: member title, firstname, surname; driver firstname, surname. This lets us search, sort and report on the data items individually rather than as a unit. The member and driver tables needed unique IDs to avoid potential confusion between different people with the same names. These IDs are used as key fields for their tables. 1NF also requires each field to refer to the key, but in this table there is no unique key field: you'd have to use membername+drivername as a combined key. Adding key fields to the members and drivers tables avoids that: now, each field in those tables relates directly to the key in that table. e.g. a member's address and title are both connected to that member's ID.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Using a combination of fields as a key is A Bad Idea, because it allows 2NF failure. 2NF is never going to be a problem if you create a unique key field in each table you create. 2NF says that each field in a table must refer to the whole key, not just part of it. The original table fails because if we use membername+drivername as the key, the member address only relates to the membername, not the drivername. And the driver's Car rate only relates to the drivername, not the membername. This violates 2NF. Creating the separate key fields in each table avoids this problem.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Having only the member and driver table was a partial solution, but it had its limitations: one driver could help many members, but a member would be tied to a single driver. It would be impossible for a member to use different drivers on different days without using a many:many relationship, and RDBMS do not allow many:many relationships!</p>
<p class="myanswer">Another problem is that a history of trips would not be possible to produce since there is no record of individual trips: the driver's payrate is just increased after each trip. This is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="myanswer">To solve these problems, a &quot;line table&quot; is used to avoid having a many:many relationship. It acts as an intermediary between the two main tables. One record in the trips table records the member, the driver and the trip cost. The calcTotalFee field is a calculated field equal to Drivers_Table::numYearsWorked * Drivers_Table::numCarRate.</p>
<p class="myanswer">With referential integrity turned on (in Access - RI does not exist in Filemaker Pro), database integrity can be helped by preventing the deletion of drivers who have trip data that refers to their record.</p>
<p class="myanswer">3NF requires that each non-key field in table should refer to nothing but the key field. In the normalised database, each non-key field in each table relates only to the key field in that table. e.g. the totalfee relates to the trip that produced it, not to the driver to whom it applies.</p>
<p class="comment">I confidently predict that the average mark for this question will be about 1.5 out of 6! Six marks for a normalisation question is grossly excessive and unfair. Detailed normalisation theory is <strong>not</strong> something for year 12 students to have to worry about.</p>
<p class="comment">APRIL 2013 - ha... I knew it! <span class="examiner">The average mark was <strong>1.7 out of 6</strong>.</span> <span class="examiner">38% of students got zero.</span></p>
<p class="examiner">Few students gave complete responses to this question. Many were able to correctly normalise the data but did not 
  attempt to explain how each normal form contributes to data being stored efficiently and redundancy or repetition being  avoided. <br />
  Some responses comprised drawings of tables that were accompanied by explanations. Other responses consisted of 
  explanations with references to examples of changes to the fields shown in the original table. Both types of responses
  were acceptable.</p>
<p class="examiner">With regard to the first normal form, students either stated that a field should contain only a single item of data and 
  provided an example or they prepared a new table in which the 'Address' field was separated into three new fields of 
  'StreetNumber', 'StreetName' and 'Suburb'. An explanation of the reason for this adjustment was also required. The 
  most frequent explanation for separating the 'Suburb' from the 'StreetName' or the 'FirstName' from the 'LastName' is 
  it allows for greater accuracy and more detailed searches. For example, 'drivers can be grouped by suburb and then <br />
  assigned to jobs so that driving time is reduced' and 'names can be sorted alphabetically by LastName so that browsing
  a list is faster'.<br />
  With regard to the second normal form, students either stated that the fields should be grouped into two separate tables 
  of 'Member' and 'Driver' so that each field could relate to a unique identifier or primary key for that field, and provided 
  an example, or they prepared the two tables and explained the need for the primary key fields of 'MemberID' and 
  'DriverID'. Other accepted explanations included 'creating relationships' and problems associated with 'deleting and 
  updating records'.<br />
  With regard to the third normal form, students either stated that one field should not rely on another field or indicated 
  with a diagram that the 'TotalFee' should be calculated in a query or report by multiplying the data from the 
  'YearsWorked' and 'CarRate' fields. The most frequent explanations were that this was more efficient because 'data 
  was not repeated' and calculations were 'processed only when needed'.</p></td>

<td><p align="left"><br />
AppsNow is a company that provides a website where young programmers can advertise and sell their software applications (apps). AppsNow uses cloud computing so that programmers can store their apps and discuss their latest projects online, and receive payments for apps that are sold.</p>
<p align="left">a.&nbsp;&nbsp; Describe how AppsNow can make sure that the apps stored online are safe from hackers. 2 marks</p>
<ul>
<li class="myanswer">Require authorised users to use a username and strong password to access the apps.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Encrypt the app files so they can't be opened even if a hacker manages to get to them.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Use SSL or TLS connections to prevent user or app details being observed in transit.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Ensure the site is protected by a router and a software firewall to prevent port sniffing and unauthorised communication port access.
</li>
</ul>
<p class="examiner">This question was very well answered, with most students providing appropriate examples to support their 
  recommendations and strategies.The most frequently accepted response to this question was 'encrypt the Apps-R-Us files so that they are unreadable to 
  anyone who does not have the encryption key'. Responses that suggested a firewall and clearly described how it 
  protected the apps stored online from external threats were also awarded marks.</p>
<p class="examiner">Average mark was 1.3</p>

<li class="myanswer">Compare the file size of the uploaded file on the server with the size it was before it was sent.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Download the app that has just been uploaded and try to run it.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Compare the uploaded file's MD5 hash value with that of the file before upload.
</li>
</ul>
<p class="comment">What an odd question. What point was it trying to make, I wonder? It does not seem relevant to anything in the study design.</p>
<p class="examiner">Successful testing strategies involved comparing two versions of a file. Some students suggested uploading a file twice 
  and comparing the two. Others suggested checking that all of the coding is present in both copies of the file.</p>

</ul>
<p align="left" class="examiner">There was a variety of accepted responses to this question. The most common response was that backup and retrieval 
  depends on the internet functioning. Other acceptable responses included<br />
  &#61623; security depends on procedures being followed correctly at a remote location<br />
  &#61623; processes are managed by people you do not know <br />

<p class="myanswer"><strong>To compare models</strong></p>
<p class="myanswer">Test data could be as simple as a single field containing a bike model and the number sold in the transaction. If the database has to isolate records from the past 3 months, a date field would also be required. Use a find on the date field with a value of (say) &quot;&gt;=1/1/2012 AND &lt;=31/3/2012&quot; to find records.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Gather the sales records from the 3 months, including the model of the bike sold. Sort the records by the model field. Create a layout (Filemaker) that has a subsummary part with MODEL as its break field. In the subsummary part, put a summary field defined as NumSold = &quot;SUM OF NumSold&quot;. This will display the total bikes sold for each model. From this they can easily see the worst-selling models. (I don't know how you'd do this in Access.) </p>
<p class="myanswer"><strong>To give sales bonuses (boni?)</strong></p>
<p class="myanswer">Each test data record needs to include salespersonID (and date if necessary. Use the method described above to locate the records from the required 3 months) and the number of bikes sold in the transaction. Ensure at least one salespersonID has 20 or more sales.</p>
<p class="myanswer">In the sales table, create a summary field defined as CountOfSales = &quot;SUM of NumSold&quot; to count the occurences of models. Sort the data by SalespersonID and create a layout with a trailing subsummary part containing the salesperson ID and the summary field. The layout will show/print a sorted list of IDs with a count of their sales. </p>
<p class="myanswer">To sweeten the deal, create a calculated BONUS field defined as IF(CountOfSales&gt;20, &quot;Bonus&quot;, &quot;No Bonus&quot;) and show the value of this field along with the total sales figure.</p>
<p align="left" class="examiner">Students who selected RDBMS software included an introductory description or drawing of the tables and fields. For 
  example, 'Create database tables 'Staff', 'Bicycles' and 'Sales' with the fields 'StaffID' and 'BicycleModelID', and 
  'SaleID' and 'QuantitySold' in the 'Sales' table. Then 'At the end of three months the Manager would &hellip;'<br />
  Review the sales trends<br />
  &#61623; Create a report with a graph using the 'QuantitySold' field to show trends in monthly sales or give the manager 
  a picture of sales trends for each model with a summary table.<br />
  &#61623; An accepted response for testing the functionality of the solution was 'change quantities sold for the two 
  models each month and check the actual graph'.</p>
<span class="examiner">Drop the two models<br />
&#61623; Create a report using the 'SUM for each Bicycle Model' and display the list sorted A to Z. Identify the two 
lowest-selling models.<br />
&#61623; An accepted response for testing the functionality of the solution was 'use equal quantities sold for some 
models and check the actual minimums'.<br />
Reward sales staff<br />
&#61623; Create a query using 'QuantitySold is greater than 20' to list all 'StaffID who get a bonus'.<br />

<p><span class="examiner">Students who selected spreadsheet software included an introductory description or drawing of the column structure in 
  their response. For example, 'Set up a spreadsheet with 'Staff', 'Bicycles' and 'Sales' worksheets. Use columns for 
  'StaffID', 'BicycleModel' and 'QuantitySold' in the 'Sales' worksheet to record each sale. Then 'At the end of three 
  months the Manager would &hellip;.'<br />
Review the sales trends<br />
&#61623; Select the 'BicycleModel' and 'QuantitySold' columns to create a column graph to show monthly sales during 
  the three-month period. This will give the manager a visual indication of sales trends for each model.<br />
&#61623; An accepted response for testing the functionality of the solution was 'use various quantities sold for some 
  models each month and check against the expected graph'.<br />
Drop the two models<br />
&#61623; Use a 'SUM' formula to record the total of 'QuantitySold' for each model and 'SORT function A to Z' to 
  identify the two lowest-selling models.<br />
&#61623; An accepted response for testing the functionality of the solution was 'create equal quantities sold for some 
  models and compare to the expected output'.<br />
Reward sales staff<br />
&#61623; Use an 'IF QuantitySold is greater than 20' statement to create an alert in a column called 'Bonus'.<br />
