    <td ><h2>Data acquisition</h2>
     <p>Primary and secondary data can be acquired using observation, interviews, querying of resources, surveys and questionnaires.</p>
     <h3>Types of questions</h3>
     <p>An <strong>open </strong>(or open-ended) <strong>question</strong> - often used in interviews - is one that does not limit the length, type or content of the answer. e.g. &ldquo;What would you like for lunch?&rdquo; Open questions are often better for opinion-based questions.</p>
     <p>A <strong>closed question</strong> - typically found in surveys and questionnaires - forces answers to take a particular form, or allows only pre-determined responses. e.g. &ldquo;Would you prefer Chinese or Mexican for lunch?&rdquo; Closed questions are good for collecting facts and numbers.</p>
     <h4>Closed questions</h4>
     <p>Offering a limited choice of responses can make it quicker and easier for respondents to answer questions, but they usually cannot give reasons or explanations. </p>
     <p>Collating and analysing closed answers is much easier than the longer, unstructured, vague, repetitious or ambiguous answers to open questions. Closed questions are especially suitable for online surveys and questionnaires. </p>
     <p>Closed questions may take the form of:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>yes 	or no answers using radio buttons</li>
      <li>multiple-choice 	answers, e.g. Preferred public transport: Train / Bus / Tram</li>
      <li><strong>Likert 	scales</strong> collect data that can be expressed as an attitude on a 	sliding graded scale.</li>
     </ul>
     <blockquote>
      <p><img src="/m/likert-scale.png" width="762" height="222" alt="Likert scale"/></p>
     </blockquote>
     <p></p>
     <ul>
      <li><strong>Ranked 	priorities</strong> to indicate preferences. e.g. &ldquo;Place numbers 1 to 	10 to indicate which forms of transport you prefer, from most 	favourite to least favourite.&rdquo; </li>
     </ul>
     <p>Databases allow data fields to be made compulsory, so a record won&rsquo;t be accepted while those fields are left empty. Only make fields compulsory if further processing would make no sense if the data were missing, e.g. a missing email address when signing up to a mailing list.</p>
     <p>If <em>none</em> of the available responses applies, respondents are forced to give inaccurate answers. e.g. &ldquo;Do you attend church &ndash; Frequently | Sometimes | Rarely&rdquo;. Without a &ldquo;Never&rdquo; option, the question builds bias into any information derived from the answers.</p>
     <p>The value of closed questions can be enriched by providing optional comment boxes to allow respondents to give further explanation or details.</p>
     <p>Formulating good closed questions assumes that you <em>already know</em> all of the applicable options for answers. Open questions are good for preliminary research to gain knowledge about a topic you currently know little about. e.g. if you want to learn about classical music, you would look silly asking a classical pianist a closed question like, &ldquo;Who was the all-time best musician &ndash; Mozart or Britney Spears?&rdquo;</p>
     <p>Once the subject is better understood by using open questions, higher-quality closed questions can be formulated.</p>
     <p>Closed questions rely on researchers <em>already knowing</em> what the relevant answers are. If they don't offer an answer as an option, respondents cannot choose that answer and the results will be faulty.</p>
     <h4>Open-ended questions</h4>
     <p>Open questions do not impose restrictions on answers. Respondents may give lengthy answers with explanations, examples, qualifications (e.g. &ldquo;But this only applies if&hellip;&rdquo;), personal opinions, and details; they can even critique the question itself. Answers will be individual, and usually more rich, detailed, and accurate than answers to closed questions.</p>
     <p>Open-ended questions become less valuable as the number of respondents increases. Interpreting hundreds of detailed free-form responses is very time consuming and takes a lot of judgement and processing effort to convert them into a form that can be processed statistically. Thus, researchers use <strong>coding </strong>to convert answers to open questions into a more manageable codes that can be statistically processed.</p>
     <p>How would you concisely store this answer: <em>&ldquo;Well, sort of, a little bit - you know? It depends. Yeah, no. OK. hehehe. Hmmm...&rdquo;</em>. A closed question offering only Yes/No answers would have forced the respondent to commit to a definite answer that was easy to count and average, but the vagueness, delay and depth of thought shown in the original answer would be lost &ndash; and that in itself might have been very informative to the researchers. </p>

     <p>Whether open or closed, questions can suffer from major faults:</p>
     <p>A <strong>loaded question</strong> contains controversial or unjustified assumptions that may serve to support the <strong>hidden agenda</strong> of a questioner. e.g. </p>
     <p><img src="/tip.png" width="40" height="22" alt=""/> Secret or hidden agenda &ndash; an undisclosed or disguised true ambition or ulterior motive. </p>

    <td ><h2>Interviews</h2>
     <p>Interviews are real-time personal interactions between data gatherers and data providers. The strengths of interviews include:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>unlike 	questionnaires and surveys, interview questioning can be shaped by 	the answers received. An interesting answer can be pursued to elicit 	more information.</li>
     </ul>
     <p><img src="/tip.png" width="40" height="22" alt=""/> It <em>is</em> possible to do limited follow-up on closed questions in questionnaires and surveys by using conditional paths. e.g. &ldquo;If you answered &lsquo;No&rsquo; to Question 18, proceed to Question 25.&rdquo; Questions 19 to 24 would only be asked of respondents who answered &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to question 18. </p>
     <ul>
      <li>the 	presence of a real-life interviewer can subtly change the attitude 	of the interviewee. People usually want to be helpful and dislike 	disappointing interviewers, so they are often more cooperative, 	honest and less likely to skip questions.</li>
      <li>tone 	of voice (interest, disinterest, anger, happiness) can be heard</li>
      <li>body 	language, facial expressions, pauses, hesitancy, energy, lethargy, 	and other non-verbal communication can be observed.</li>
      <li>oral 	answers tend to be longer and more detailed than written answers.</li>
      <li>personal 	interviews are more likely to elicit accurate information on 	sensitive subjects than are impersonal surveys or questionnaires.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>To gain these benefits, interviews are best done face-to-face, but this is time-consuming and expensive. </p>
     <p>Second-best is internet video conferencing which offers some of the benefits of face-to-face questioning, but is cheaper and more convenient. </p>
     <p>Telephone interviews are the last choice for real-time person-to-person information gathering since all visual cues are lost and the &lsquo;personal touch&rsquo; is weaker. </p>
     <h4>Interview technique</h4>
     <ul>
      <li>introduce 	yourself and make clear the purpose of the interview and the way the 	information will be used</li>
      <li>start 	with easy, quick questions to put nervous interviewees at ease.</li>
      <li>if 	the information may be personal, follow the spirit of the Australian 	Privacy Principles even if you are not subject to the Privacy Act</li>
      <li>have 	a list of questions prepared so you don&rsquo;t forget them</li>
      <li>avoid 	getting side-tracked by irrelevant discussion unless it&rsquo;s 	informative</li>
      <li>give 	interviewees time to think and talk</li>
      <li>don&rsquo;t 	interrupt answers unless it&rsquo;s obvious that they are irrelevant or 	repetitive</li>
      <li>gather 	the data you want to collect, but leave room for the interviewee to 	volunteer extra information you never thought of asking about. This 	can be done by including open questions, and finishing the interview 	by asking if there&rsquo;s anything else they didn&rsquo;t get an 	opportunity to say.</li>
      <li>audio-record 	interviews for later reference (with the interviewee&rsquo;s prior 	permission. Having to write down answers will distract you from 	listening actively and closely. 
      </li>
     </ul>

     <h3>DISADVANTAGES of using interviews</h3>
     <ul>
      <li>      Costly in terms of time, labour<br>
      </li>
      <li>Data obtained is qualitative (opinion-based) that must be interpreted and encoded to be able to manipulate statistically<br>
      </li>
      <li>May be subject to bias from the interviewer<br>
      </li>
      <li>The presence, appearance, age/sex or behaviour of the interviewer may make subjects be less responsive or truthful about sensitive, embarrassing or incriminating issues.</li>
     </ul>
     <h3>ADVANTAGES of interviews</h3>
     <ul>
      <li>      Valuable as a starting point for research into poorly-understood subjects.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Uncover issues and topics that are later used in broader data collection using quantitative techniques (e.g. surveys)<br>
      </li>
      <li>Significant information from non-verbal signals can be observed, e.g. hesitation, passion, evasiveness, nervousness, anger, happiness, boredom.</li>
      <li>Subjects speak, not write, so answers tend to be longer and more detailed.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The interviewer&rsquo;s presence may encourage subjects to be more cooperative. Most people want to be helpful.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Unlike surveys/questionnaires, questioning is not pre-fixed. The order and content of questions may change dynamically to pursue interesting or unexpected answers.</li>
     </ul>     </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td ><h2>Surveys and questionnaires</h2>
    <p>DISADVANTAGES</p>
    <ul>
     <li>    Being anonymous, subjects may decide to lie or boast.</li>
     <li>Difficult or sensitive questions may be left unanswered.<br>
     </li>
     <li>Using data from surveys/questionnaires that have missing answers may introduce bias into stats. </li>
     <li>      The reason that the answers were not given to certain questions may in itself be significant and need further investigation.<br>
      E.g. if 90% of females answer a certain question, but only 15% of males answer it, something is clearly interesting and important about the issue in that question!</li>
     <li>If data collectors select subjects who are passing by (e.g. in shopping centres), an unconscious bias may make the collector tend to select people of a certain age, sex, ethnicity, status or appearance which may bias the data.<br>
      E.g. young female data collectors may be nervous to stop large young men to ask for their participation.</li>
     <li>If subjects are volunteers      it may be harder to to enforce cooperation. It may introduce self-selection bias &ndash; the fact that people volunteer to answer questions may mean      they have a vested interest in the subject or 
      they are of a certain personality type that makes them want to help other people</li>
     <li>If subjects are <em>not</em> volunteers they may resent being forced to respond, and give misleading answers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>ADVANTAGES</p>
    <ul>
     <li>A lot of data can be quickly collected.<br>
     </li>
     <li>Quantitative data need not be encoded, so it&rsquo;s quick to process.
      <ul>
       <li>Can be done online<br>
       </li>
       <li>Can be electronically validated for existence, type and range.<br>
       </li>
       <li>Can collect data 24/7.<br>
       </li>
       <li>Can reach respondents in remote places.<br>
       </li>
       <li>Can deliver data immediately after its collection.<br>
       </li>
       <li>Can be modified or amended instantly, if necessary.</li>
      </ul>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="/tip.png" width="40" height="22" alt=""/>Online surveys and questionnaires can be made reactive to inputs by skipping questions that have been made irrelevant by previous answers.<br>
     <img src="/tip.png" width="40" height="22" alt=""/>Paper-based surveys and questionnaires can achieve similar reactiveness with instructions like, &rdquo;If you answered 'No' to Q7, skip to Q13&quot;.<br>

   <tr>
    <td ><h3>Interviews vs Surveys &amp; Questionnaires</h3>
     <ul>
      <li>Interviews slowly collect small amounts of deep but narrow insights person by person.    Interviews can use lots of detailed &ldquo;Why?&quot; questions. e.g. &ldquo;Why do you drink alcohol?&rdquo;</li>
      <li>Surveys and questionnaires quickly collect lots of less personal and more shallow data from a broad range of people.       They have lots of &ldquo;What&hellip;&rdquo; questions. E.g. &ldquo;What types of alcohol do you drink? How much? How often?&rdquo;       Free-form extended textual answers are rarely used.      Most answers are numerical or chosen from pre-made limited lists of options.</li>
      <li>Interviews often ask different questions of different people, so answers can be hard to compile and compare.<br>
       Surveys and questionnaires ask the same questions of all respondents, so answers can be easily compiled, averaged, sorted, graphed, compared. </li>
      <li>Interviews usually ask open-ended questions.       No fixed format, length or type of answer is enforced.       Questions usually seek opinions or reasons.</li>
      <li> Surveys and questionnaires ask close-ended (or closed) questions.       Answers have a fixed type and length of response (usually from a limited list) making all answers consistent and comparable.       Questions often seek factual information.</li>

   <tr>
    <td ><h2>Observation</h2>
     <p>Involves watching people behave naturally in their normal environment.</p>
     <p>     It can reveal facts that questions may never have anticipated.</p>
     <p>Observing people behaving naturally is very informative, since people often mistakenly or deliberately misreport their behaviour because of embarrassment, embarrassment, vanity, unawareness, ignorance, self-delusion or fear of punishment. </p>
     <p>Observation reveals what <em>really</em> happens, rather than what subjects <em>say</em> happens.<br>
     </p>
     <p>     Survey respondents may not deliberately lie, but can misremember, or not realise what they actually do.</p>
     <p>It is important that the observer stays in the background and does not intervene or interfere with natural behaviours.</p>
     <p> Sometimes subjects are unwilling to provide data voluntarily, especially if the data may lead to unpleasant consequences, so observation is the only option, e.g.</p>
     <ul>
      <li>people 	say the &ldquo;right&rdquo; thing. When trying to reduce infection rates in 	hospitals, a survey question like &ldquo;Do you always wash your hands 	after going to the toilet?&rdquo; will always elicit 100% &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; 	answers from busy doctors and nurses, but observation of actual 	behaviour may disclose the truth.      </li>
      <li>E.g. teachers are surveyed about whether they treat male and female students fairly.<br>
       The survey indicates 100% compliance.<br>
       Observation reveals 50% compliance, according to what researchers think of as &lsquo;fair&rsquo;.<br>
       Survey respondents may not deliberately lie, but may interpret &ldquo;fairness&rdquo; very differently.</li>
      <li>sking 	office workers to report the number of minutes they waste daily 	playing games instead of working is going to be less reliable than 	observing their actual time usage.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p>Observation may also be needed when impartial interpretation of behaviour is required. If studying a college&rsquo;s performance, finding whether teachers deal with students in a &ldquo;fair, friendly and open&rdquo; manner is a <strong>subjective</strong> assessment that is best not left to the teachers being judged. </p>
     <p><strong>Subjective</strong> &ndash; based on opinion or personal judgement. e.g. &ldquo;Is that salesperson friendly?&rdquo; Compare with </p>
     <p><strong>Objective</strong> &ndash; based on dispassionate logic, fact or measurement. e.g. &ldquo;How often does that salesperson smile at customers during a transaction?&rdquo;</p>
     <p>Observation is valuable when investigating the interaction between people, including their non-verbal communication. </p>
     <p>Subjects cannot be expected to see and report on themselves with 100% clarity and lack of bias, and observers who differ from their subjects may notice things that the subjects are blind to. Mature observers may see immature behaviour in younger subjects; female observers may see sexist behaviour that male subjects are unaware of; observers of a minority religion might notice unintentional or institutional intolerance in subjects of a dominant religion.</p>
     <p>Observation by an &lsquo;outsider&rsquo; may often yield valuable data to which subjects have become blinded by constant exposure. For example, an observer might notice unpleasant smells, sexist posters on walls, rude treatment of subordinates, or inefficient work practices that everyday workers might not consciously register any more.</p>
     <p>Observation may provide privileged access to events and processes that participants never get to see and cannot report on. For example, to evaluate a live theatre, an audience member can only assess what is happening in front of the curtain. An &ldquo;access all areas&rdquo; observer&rsquo;s privileged permissions allow a far greater insight into the entire operation, including backstage and even events in the manager&rsquo;s office.</p>
     <p>Observation may be <strong>overt</strong>, where subjects know they are being watched, or <strong>covert</strong>, where they are unaware. Covert observation (e.g. using cameras or &lsquo;undercover spies&rsquo;) will be more accurate, but may be more difficult or unethical to achieve.</p>
     <p>Observation can also be <strong>direct</strong>, watching behaviours as they occur (e.g. students eating in a cafeteria) or <strong>indirect</strong>, where the results of the behaviours are observed (e.g. measuring the amount of food that is left uneaten after students finish their meals.)</p>
     <p>Observation may also be electronic, through the use of activity logs, key and screen logging software, and equipment that tracks users&rsquo; eye movements when using software, watching videos or advertisements, or using other products.</p>
     <h3>Observation tips:</h3>
     <ul>
      <li>don&rsquo;t 	let your observation distort subjects&rsquo; natural behaviour</li>
      <li>prepare 	objective measures (recording sheets, checklists) to reduce the 	effect of observer bias, record data in a consistent format, and 	remind observers of what they are watching for. A personal judgement 	of whether a teacher treats male and female students equally relies 	largely on the quality of an observer&rsquo;s opinion, and 	interpretation of what &ldquo;equal treatment&rdquo; means. More reliable 	would be a count of how often the teacher responds to hands raised 	by males and females, and a measurement of the average amount of 	time spent helping male and females.</li>
      <li>record<em> field notes</em>: open-ended recordings of observations that were not 	anticipated when the research began. They add details, and do not 	answer pre-planned questions or topics.</li>
      <li>if 	observation is overt, gain the trust, consent and confidence of your 	subjects by explaining the purpose of the observation.</li>
      <li>if 	appropriate, reassure subjects that they will not be judged or 	punished. Offer to share the research results with them.</li>
      <li>remain 	professionally detached. While developing rapport with subjects is 	desirable, becoming emotionally attached to them can distort an 	observer&rsquo;s objective judgement.</li>
      <li>keep 	ongoing records, notes and recordings. Relying on your memory is 	unreliable.</li>
      <li>record 	exact quotes, not your interpretation of what was said.</li>
      <li>describe 	events without interpretation or evaluation. That can happen later.</li>
      <li>separate 	your own thoughts, opinions, expectations, experiences and 	assumptions from what you actually observe.</li>
     </ul>
     <h3>Disadvantages of observation</h3>
     <ul>

    <td ><h2><a name="_Toc411945383"></a>Surveys and questionnaires</h2>
     <p>A survey usually gathers primary data and opinions on a variety of broad issues. It is often used when research begins and little is known about the subject. </p>
     <p>A questionnaire is often more focused than a survey, and gathers data that is more detailed and specific.</p>
     <p><em>Advantages</em></p>
     <ul>
      <li>a 	lot of data can be gathered quickly and cheaply.</li>
      <li>responses 	can be easily compiled, processed and analysed using spreadsheets, 	databases or custom software.</li>
      <li>since 	everyone is asked exactly the same questions, responses can easily 	be counted, averaged and compared.</li>
      <li>without 	the personal presence of a questioner, observer bias is removed.</li>
      <li>they 	can be widely and cheaply distributed in great quantities 	(especially if online).</li>
     </ul>
     <p><em>Disadvantages</em></p>
     <ul>
      <li>responses 	usually lack explanation or detail about context</li>
      <li>statistical 	results describe average trends, but say little about individual 	motives or feelings</li>
      <li>follow-up 	questioning may be impossible</li>
      <li>subjects 	are more likely to lie or fail to answer sensitive or embarrassing 	questions</li>
      <li>respondents 	may interpret questions differently, e.g. &ldquo;Do you visit shopping 	centres frequently, sometimes, or rarely?&rdquo; To one person, 	&ldquo;frequently&rdquo; may mean daily; to another, it may mean weekly.</li>
      <li>questionnaires 	cannot answer respondents&rsquo; queries</li>
      <li>respondents 	may not bother completing lengthy written responses. It may be hard 	or impossible to force compliance.</li>
      <li>if 	response is purely voluntary, the only respondents who submit 	answers may be those with strong opinions on the research topic, 	thereby introducing a <strong>self-selection bias</strong> into the data. </li>
     </ul>
     <h4>Writing questionnaires and surveys</h4>
     <ul>
      <li>clearly 	decide what data you need to gather. Focus on a clearly-defined 	topic. </li>
      <li>write 	concise, specific questions. Vague questions will yield vague, 	ambiguous answers</li>
      <li>remove <strong>leading </strong>and<strong> loaded questions</strong>. You are a researcher 	seeking the truth, not an activist seeking to create the truth.</li>
      <li>decide 	which questions should be closed and which should be open. Closed 	questions are appropriate for basic information and are easy for 	subjects to answer. Open questions probe issues more deeply, but 	require more effort from respondents so they should not be 	over-used. If subjects see page after page of blank lines for 	written answers they may lose patience and stop responding. Reserve 	open-ended questions for the <em>really</em> important questions that 	are worth the extra effort required of respondents and analysts.</li>
      <li>try 	out the questions with test subjects and get feedback:
       <ul>
        <li>do 		questions make clear and logical sense?</li>
        <li>is 		the language readable?</li>
        <li>are 		respondents giving the data you need?</li>
        <li>why 		are respondents skipping questions &ndash; confusion, privacy concerns, 		boredom, annoyance?</li>
       </ul>
      </li>
      <li>include 	important information such as:
       <ul>
        <li>the 		purpose of the research </li>
        <li>assurances 		of confidentiality</li>
        <li>thanks 		at the end</li>
       </ul>
      </li>
      <li>protect 	respondents&rsquo; privacy: do not make them nervous by asking for 	unnecessary personal information (name, address, age, income). Only 	ask about sensitive information (e.g. race, religion, politics or 	sexual issues) if it&rsquo;s crucial.
      </li>
     </ul>
     <p><img src="/tip.png" width="40" height="22" alt="Tip"/> Ages and incomes can be politely investigated by asking for <em>ranges</em>, e.g. &ldquo;Are you aged: 13-17, 18-21,22-29&rdquo; etc.</p>
     <h4>Choosing samples</h4>
     <p>You will rarely be able to survey 100% of the target population, so you must choose a sample. Make sure samples are representative and not biased or atypical or you will collect biased data from which you will generate inaccurate information.</p>
     <ul>
      <li>American 	electioneers in the 1920s used a telephone survey to find who people 	would vote for. The poll predicted a huge victory for the 	conservative candidate. The election result, however, was a massive 	victory for the other candidate. Using the telephone system to 	conduct the poll introduced a large bias because in those days only 	wealthy families could afford telephones, so the only people polled 	were wealthy and more likely to vote conservative.</li>
      <li>A 	company conducted a door-to-door survey asking whether government 	pensions were adequate. An unexpectedly high number of responses 	said &ldquo;no&rdquo;. Why? The survey was conducted during week-day working 	hours, and there was a disproportionate number of unemployed, aged 	and infirm people at home at that time to answer the door and 	respond to the poll.</li>
      <li><strong>Self-selection 	bias</strong>. A pollster in a supermarket found that an unusually-high 	number of shoppers did charity work. Why? Because the sort of person 	who does charity work is also the sort of kind, empathetic and 	helpful person who would stop and help out a poor, hard-working 	pollster in a supermarket. Simply choosing to participate in the 	survey self-selected a certain type of respondent, which can lead to 	bias in the results.</li>
     </ul>
     <h4>Distributing questions</h4>
     <p>Rarely can you <em>force</em> people to answer research questions, so finding a representative sample for a survey or questionnaire is not easy.</p>
     <ul>
      <li>approach 	people in public places, being careful not to unconsciously select 	or avoid people of certain sexes, ages, races, or appearance</li>
      <li>use 	an online survey with <em>Google Drive</em> or similar software, but 	be aware that any online poll will automatically bias the sample 	towards younger, wealthier, more technologically-capable 	respondents.</li>
      <li>poll 	your peers &ndash; but this of course also introduces an automatic bias 	towards young people living in a certain socio-economic class, 	possibly with restricted religious, cultural, gender, or ethnic 	variety</li>
      <li>leave 	copies of the surveys in shops &ndash; but self-selection will result in 	a high number of responses from people with a strong attitude for or 	against the topic you are researching. People with no strong 	feelings won&rsquo;t bother filling in a voluntary survey</li>
     </ul>
