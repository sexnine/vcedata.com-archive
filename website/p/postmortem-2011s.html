Answer is D (or B maybe)</p>

B specifically mentions email, which is how I understand worms propagate. I may be wrong about whether they <strong>only</strong> use email.<br />
C assumes worms attach to files, which they don't.
Maybe. If they're self-contained, they do their damage like normal exe files.<br />
D is possible, but worms don't travel alone. They need a medium, like email.&nbsp;
Maybe. Perhaps.&nbsp; I'll have to look this up!</p>

B would be intuitive to users, but selecting tiny countries like Israel or Vatican city could be difficult on a small display!<br />

<p > b.&nbsp;&nbsp; Explain how a security audit of the computer network may have prevented the original network breach at Big O Television.</p>
<p class="myanswer" >A security audit is a systematic technical assessment of how data security is managed in a system. Unlike a penetration test, which is done without special privileges, an audit is carried out - with full privileges and inside information - within the system to assess security weaknesses. They may use interviews with staff, vulnerability scans, technical inspections, reviewing security policy and procedures, and the use of network monitoring software. The audit may inspect password policies, review audit trails, check the state of security patches on key software, test the disaster recovery plan, etc.</p>
<p>2 marks</p>
<p><span class="examiner">State average was 50%</span></p>
<p>A security audit is a preventative security measure; it not only examines the equipment (hardware and software) but
other elements of the information system (people and procedure) to ensure there are no security issues.<br />
For full marks students needed to demonstrate knowledge of the function of a security audit and apply this knowledge
to the case study.<br />
The following is an example of a high-scoring response.</p>
<p><em>A security audit would have involved security experts examining the security of the system to identify weaknesses and gaps in the
security. This may have involved the identification of the weakness that allowed the original network breach, thus allowing Big O
Television to remove the weakness. The breach therefore may have been prevented.</em></p>
<p>This question required students to show their knowledge of security techniques and how the techniques may be tested. It
is important that students read questions carefully and ensure they are answering the question asked, as a number of
students wrote about what security could be implemented. Students are encouraged to highlight or underline key words
and phrases in questions during writing time.</p>

<p align="left"> Caitlin and Ryan are discussing the best way to store their new software solution and the data files it uses. The software, which company employees will need to access every day, is 80 gigabytes (GB) and uses several data files which will grow in size over time.</p>
<p align="left"> Caitlin suggests the software should be stored on the file server and the data files could be stored on DVDs. </p>
<p align="left">Ryan suggests that as the software is not very large (80 GB) it could also be kept on the same DVD as the data files. </p>
<p align="left">The network administrator is not happy with either solution.<br />
</p>
<p align="left">Provide a better solution for Caitlin and Ryan and give three reasons to support your solution.</p>
<p align="left" class="comment">When I first read this, I had to sit down. I assumed it had to be a complex misprint. But no, it's a serious question.&nbsp; It's hard to know where to start with the massive unreality of this case study.&nbsp; Caitlin and Ryan should not be let loose from a sheltered workshop, much less working with real IT.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left" class="comment">- Let's start with the software. It's said to be 80G... 80,000 megabytes.&nbsp; Even Windows 7 is nowhere NEAR 80G!&nbsp; My entire Windows and Program Files directories only add up to 47G - and I have a <em>lot</em> of programs!&nbsp; What does this software do - run the <strong>planet</strong>?<br />
<br />
- It's absurd that IT professionals would even for a second consider storing data files on DVD. It means the data must be read-only, but it's said that the files will grow in size over time, so they must be read-write. A hamster would know that. Caitlin doesn't.<br />
<br />
- &quot;Ryan suggests that as the software is not very large (80G)...&quot;&nbsp; What <strong>would</strong> he consider large?? Ryan should not be allowed anywhere near an information system.<br />
<br />
- He wants to store the 80G software on a DVD?&nbsp; My grandmother had a old rooster who knew that you can only fit 4.7G of data on a DVD. The rooster deserves Ryan's job. And Ryan even wanted to add the read-write data to the DVD as well.&nbsp; Dear oh dear.<br />
<br />
- Next, even if they built a 16 metre-wide DVD to fit 80G of data, how could the software run from there without being installed on a computer? Not much software can run without being installed on a computer. Some software runs on networks, but at 80G, it would take users centuries to get anything done with it.<br />
<br />
- Even if the software <strong><em>could</em></strong> be run from the DVD, how will it write new or changed data to the DVD? </p>
<p align="left" class="comment">Surely the examiners could have come up with a scenario that tested students' technical knowledge just as effectively without turning it into a 'Three&nbsp;Stooges Do I.T.' farce? This question was <strong>nearly</strong> as bad as an Adam Sandler movie.</p>
<p>Solution</p>
<p> <span class="myanswer">Take Caitlin and Ryan out the back, shoot them, and then terminate their employment.</span></p>
<p class="myanswer"> The 80G software would need to be installed on the hard disks of workstations. The data files could be stored on the file server.</p>

<ul>
<li class="myanswer">Read-write files cannot be put on DVD</li>
<li class="myanswer">80G will not fit on a DVD</li>

<h2 align="left">Bigton City Car Parking</h2>
<p align="left"> The large regional city of Bigton has a busy central business district (CBD). Over the last few years parking in the CBD has become a concern. One difficulty is that too many people overstay the time limits of the parking bays in the CBD's streets. Employing enough parking officers has also become a problem, so the Bigton City Council has decided to look for a technological solution to the problem.</p>
<p align="left"> City Engineer, James Jones, proposed that the city purchases and installs a commercially available solution that detects vehicles that have overstayed the time limit. However, after examining one such solution, the Council decided that it provided a lot of features the city would never use and it was too expensive. The Council asked James to investigate creating the city's own solution. Its only purpose would be to detect overstaying vehicles and notify parking officers where these vehicles are parked.</p>
<p align="left">
After some thought and investigation, James drew the plan shown below.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Parking Infringement Monitoring System (PIMS)</strong></p>
<table width="100%" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">

<p>During his investigation James found out that the Council gives all its parking officers a mobile phone for use on the job, which means that these do not have to be purchased for the system; they would just need some software written for them. He also found that all the other hardware needed for the system, including a portable Bluetooth printer, can be purchased 'off the shelf'.</p>
<p> The CDUs and RDLs operate automatically, but the dedicated computer would need software written for it. The computer can be connected to the Council's existing network, which would allow it to interact with the Council's fines-payment system.</p>
<p> To take his idea further, James hired programmer Kirsten Koder.</p>
<p> After interviewing James, Kirsten drew a use case diagram of the proposed Parking Infringement Monitoring System (PIMS). It is shown below.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="/m/pm/11s-cs-ucd.jpg" width="442" height="459" /></p>
<p align="left"><strong>The Car Detection Unit (CDU)</strong></p>
<p align="left"> The type of CDU James has decided to use in the system is a small self-contained device about 5 cm long. It is designed to be placed just under the surface of a road. When the magnetic field around it is disturbed by a car, the CDU transmits a data signal that contains a 12-digit code as shown below.</p>
<p align="left"><img src="/m/pm/11s-cs-cdu.jpg" width="525" height="208" /></p>
<p>Since 1990, each parking bay in Bigton has been allocated a bay number, as shown in a section of the city map below. Since the CDU ID number is programmed at the factory and cannot be changed, James has decided that the best way to provide its location is to match the CDU ID to the bay number.</p>

<p>Most students were able to identify that the data transfer from CDU to RDL was the one that did not require TCP/IP.
However, many students struggled to provide a technically accurate description as to why it was not required. TCP/IP is
a protocol for Internet use and the use of the Internet is not required for this data transfer. Stating 'because it is not
required' was not sufficient and simply restated the question.<br />
The following is an example of a high-scoring response. </p>

Explanation: The data does not transfer using the Internet. Because TCP/IP is only for data transfer over the Internet the

<p>1 + 3 = 4 marks</p>
<p><span class="examiner">State average was 46%</span></p>
<p>The most critical non-functional requirement in this situation is response rate. When justifying a choice, students who
appropriately contrasted response rate with the other non-functional choices generally provided better responses.<br />
It is important that students are conversant with the terminology used in the problem-solving methodology stated on
pages 16&ndash;18 of the study design. It was apparent that many students did not recognise, or understand, the term
'functional requirement' &ndash; part of the analysis stage of the problem-solving methodology.</p>
<p> The following are examples of high-scoring responses.<br />
<em>Justification: The success of the system depends on whether it can inform parking officers of overstaying cars in time for them to
give these cars a ticket. The system's response rates will therefore need to be quick enough to get this information to the officers
in time for it to be used. User friendliness and maintainability do not necessarily effect whether the system fulfils its purpose, but
in this case the response rates of the system are critical to its success,<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>Justification: Seeing as how the parking officer will need constant updates as the whereabouts of each overstaying vehicle, the
response times between detecting an overdue car then the RDL sending this information through to the council's dedicated
computer and then on to the parking inspector will need to be very short. How easy the program is to use is irrelevant because
there is no handling by users, it is all automatic beside the information received by the officer, and the maintainability, whilst in
its own right be an important part, is not considered as it is required but the devices are assumed to be very robust.</em></p>

<p>The majority of students were able to identify queue as the correct data structure. It was clear that students had covered
this material well as they were able to articulate the fundamental difference between queues and stacks, that being the
order is which data is handled &ndash; first in first out (FIFO) for queues versus last in first out (LIFO) for stacks. In this case
the tickets needed to be processed as they were received, so a queue was required.<br />
</p>
<p>The following is an example of a high-scoring response.<br />
<em>Choice: A queue structure should be chosen by Kristen<br />
Justification: Kristen should choose a queue structure because it operates in a FIFO (first in first out) nature. Therefore the first
message which will be sent to the officers mobile will be the first which is processed and dealt with which enable officers to deal
with the infringements in the order in which they occur, as opposed to always having the first infringement processed last (like
the operation of the stack) as offenders could never be punished as they are gone by the time the officer makes it on site.</em></p>

I'm not sure the examiners intended this. Were they, I wonder, if thinking that the actual outcomes were (1) valid, (2) invalid, (3) erroneously valid as I originally did?</p>

<p class="examiner" >When completing a testing table, students should ensure that the expected outcome and actual outcome are based
directly on the algorithm in the case study. Many students wrote words such as 'true' or 'invalid', which showed
understanding but did not reflect the messages displayed by the algorithm.</p>

<p>The majority of students found this question challenging. Algorithms and testing are both covered in two of the four
Areas of Study and students need to develop their understanding of each. Students should practise these types of
questions either in classroom activities using past examination papers or in assessment where appropriate.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Question 10</strong></p>
<p align="left"> Kirsten is concerned about the storing of offenders' details if parking officers lost or even left their mobile phones on their desks at work.</p>
<p align="left"> State two features Kirsten should build into the mobile phone software to ensure that the data in the parking officers' mobile phones is secure.</p>
<p align="left"> For each feature, explain how it would help secure the data.</p>
<p>Feature 1 - <span class="myanswer">password-protected login</span></p>
<p>Explanation - <span class="myanswer">prevents unauthorised people using the software</span></p>
<p>Feature 2 - <span class="myanswer">encryption of stored and transmitted data</span></p>
<p>Explanation - <span class="myanswer">prevents unauthorised people 'sniffing' data travelling wirelessly. Also prevents people being able to read data stolen from the device's storage.</span></p>
<p >4 marks</p>
<p class="examiner" >State average was 69%</p>
<p class="examiner" >Students' familiarity with mobile phones was in some cases a limitation to them providing accurate responses to this
question. A number of students simply described a list of mobile phone safeguards &ndash; for example, a timed screen lock&ndash; rather than what should be built into the software to ensure the security of the data.<br />
</p>
<p class="examiner" >The following is an example of a high-scoring response.<br />
Feature 1: Password authentication<br />
Explanation: This would only enable the authorised people to access the data who knew the password. Therefore, the data could
not be easily stolen.<br />
Feature 2: Encryption<br />
Explanation: Even if the phone was compromised the data would be unreadable to everyone except the person or people it is
intended for eg by using public/private key authentication. This means that the data even if it is removed from the phones can't be
accesses by unauthorised people. Therefore, only the council and parking inspectors need to be able to decrypt this data.</p>

<p align="left"><br />
A friend, Jose, argues with Kirsten that if she uses single letters for variable and procedure names, her program code would be 20% smaller and hence she would be producing more efficient software.<br />
</p>
A.<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/indent.lbi" -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- #EndLibraryItem --> Explain why Kirsten should ignore this advice.<p></p>
<p class="myanswer" >The names would be meaningless and would require constantly referring to a data dictionary to find out what the variables and procedures contained or did. It could also easily lead to errors by using the wrong variables.</p>
<p >2 marks</p>
<p ><span class="examiner">State average was 50%</span></p>
<p class="examiner" >Students needed to demonstrate an understanding of efficiency in their explanation. According to the study design
glossary 'measures of an efficient solution include the speed of processing, the functionality of the solution, the ease of
use of the solution &hellip;' Full marks were awarded to responses that focused on processing and ease of use.<br />
</p>
<p class="examiner" >The following is an example of a high-scoring response.<br />
<em>It is the processing of lines rather than reading variable and procedure names that take up processing time, so any efficiency
gains would be too small to be measurable. Furthermore, single letter variables and procedure names make code hard to
understand making development and maintenance more difficult.</em></p>
<p > b.&nbsp;&nbsp; State one other action, besides using meaningful names, Kirsten could perform to make her program code more programmer friendly.</p>
<p class="myanswer" >Lots of useful, relevant internal documentation.</p>

<em>Kristen should include meaningful internal documentation.</em></p>

</p>
<p>Most students were able to show that a naming convention and internal documentation were essential elements for the
maintainability of the code by the programmer or a future programmer, and that variable length had little, if any, impact
on the efficiency of the software. </p>

<p align="left"> Kirsten is sure that all of the errors are now out of the software and that it is ready to be used by the Bigton City Council. The final testing process is to complete the User Acceptance Testing (UAT), but James is not entirely sure what this is and how he will be involved.</p>
<p align="left"> a.<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/indent.lbi" -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- #EndLibraryItem --> Explain the process of UAT and how James and the other staff will be involved.</p>
<p class="myanswer" >UAT is testing the opinions of people who will actually use the software once it is released. This is important because these people will have to use it, and can offer valuable feedback from a experienced user's point of view. It is not done by developers, who are too close to the system and may not see its faults, or managers who would be unlikely to know what is important from a regular user's perspective. </p>
<p >3 marks</p>
<p ><span class="examiner">State average was 47%</span></p>
<p class="examiner" >Most students struggled to provide a detailed response, limiting their responses to statements about 'checking the
system does what is intended'. In addition, many students confused user acceptance testing (UAT) with evaluation.<br />
User acceptance testing occurs in the development stage during testing activities, generally as the last testing step before
implementation and user sign-off that the programming solution meets the requirements in the software Requirements
Specifications (SRS). The UAT would then be evaluated for its effectiveness as part of an evaluation strategy.<br />
</p>
<p class="examiner" >For full marks students needed to address what is involved in user acceptance testing, James' role in this and how other
staff would be involved.<br />
</p>
<p class="examiner" >The following are examples of high-scoring responses.<br />
<em>The user acceptance testing is done at the end of development and requires the Bigton City Council staff such as James to test the
solution to make sure it operates in the intended manner. They will use numerous tests such as accuracy tests, response rate tests
to make sure that it operates correctly before signing off on the solution.<br />
</em></p>
<p class="examiner" ><em>A UAT is the process of finding out if the software meets the requirements and the expectations of the end user. The parking staff
will be involved in testing the mobile software and each of the other staff members will test if their section functions correctly.

criterion in terms of a question; others identified if the criterion was a measure of efficiency or effectiveness and then
provided an example.<br />

<em>The PIMS must be able to send overstay data to the mobile phones of parking inspectors.<br />

<p align="left"><strong>Question 14</strong></p>
<p align="left"> To evaluate the success of the PIMS, Kirsten needs to collect a range of data.<br />
Suggest a strategy that she might use to acquire data relating to the accuracy of the parking fines that are issued.</p>
<ul>
<li class="myanswer">She could check council logs to count how many complaints there have been by motorists about incorrect fines being issued. </li>

<p >3 marks</p>
<p ><span class="examiner">State average was 33%</span></p>
<p class="examiner" >This question required students to suggest a strategy to evaluate the accuracy of the parking fine issued. A number of
students missed the key word 'accuracy' and provided a general answer. As in previous years many students found it
difficult to develop a strategy. A strategy is a method by which an activity is carried out; this would include a set of
steps or procedures, i.e. What will be done? When does it happen? Who does it? etc. Evaluation questions can be found
on previous exams and these questions should be used as appropriate in classwork and in assessments.</p>
<p class="examiner" >For full marks responses needed to consider what data needed to be collected, who was collecting it and from where,
and what type of information was being generated to measure the accuracy of the solution.<br />
</p>
<p class="examiner" >The following are examples of high-scoring responses.<br />
<em>After approximately 6 months, Kirsten should attempt to collect data as to the accuracy of parking fines produced. To do this
Kirsten should consult documents, or logs, letters, emails, telephone correspondence (possibly notes taken by the council when
on the phone to clients). All of this information will show how many complaints there have been from customers over the last 6
months to determine how well Kirsten's solution is working. She could also survey customers to see if they notice improvements
or agree with the accuracy of the fines. This could be done through the post or email or online survey.<br />
</em></p>
<p class="examiner" ><em>Kirsten may wish to count the number of complaints from motorists in relation to being overcharged in their parking fines. If this
number is lower than the previous system then it is an indicator of success although it should be noted that more parking fines
are likely to be issued with the new system increasing error amounts.<br />
Kirsten should review any documents relating to the public's complaints with regards to the fines that were issued. She could </em><em>survey affected people as to whether the parking fine was accurate when they came to pay their fine, bearing in mind that some
people will lie about whether they deserve parking fines. She should also interview some parking officers as the whether they
have noticed inaccuracies in the new system</em></p>

The key users of the new PIMS developed by Kirsten are the parking officers. The Council wants Kirsten to develop a training program to teach them how to use the new software.<br />
</p>
A.<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/indent.lbi" -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- #EndLibraryItem --> Describe a suitable training program she could use.<p></p>
<p class="myanswer" >The case study does not say how many officers need training. If there are not too many (e.g. a dozen or fewer), they could be trained in a single group with practical hands-on experience.<br />
If there are many of them, a group lecture could introduce the system to them all, and selected officers could be trained as trainers to teach the rest.<br />
If they were all trained at the same time, it would need to happen outside of normal work hours 
so people don't get away with illegal parking.

trainer' or 'onsite group training'; however, a range of responses were appropriate as long as they were applicable to the<br />
organisation.</p>
<p > b.&nbsp;&nbsp; Suggest how the Council could measure the suitability of this program.</p>
<p class="myanswer" >They could test trained officers in the use of the system and see how many mistakes the officers made. If trained offers used the system accurately and quickly, the training would be considered a success.</p>

<p>Suitable responses included a method of data collection (for example, a survey, interviewing, a written test or
observing) and what was to be collected (for example, questions such as was the training sufficient or who was the data
to be collected from &ndash; the parking inspector) or when this would occur (for example, at the conclusion of the training
program).

The following is an example of high-scoring response.</p>
<p><em>Parking officers: The parking officers may resist the council's changes and be angry about the new system since they weren't
warned or told why. This could result in for example, strike action or an increase in sick days.
Motorists will complain that the council is deliberately attempting to raise revenue from PIMS and that the software is
unfair/unjust.</em></p>
