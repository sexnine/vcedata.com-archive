          <p class="examiner" > Drawing a <strong>Gantt chart</strong> (Question 2): when drawing the dependencies students need to start at the end of the last task and go to the start of the next task and through the milestone. Marks are not awarded if the line for the dependencies either starts or finishes in the middle of the task. Milestones need to be on the line (start of the day that the milestone relates to) and students need to identify reasons why a response needs to be codified (Question 4a.). </p>

        <li>
          <p class="examiner" > A large number of students did not know or understand what a <strong>Geographic Information System (GIS)</strong> was (Question 9) nor could they explain how that information could be used in a visualisation. </p>

        <li>
          <p class="examiner" > Students struggled with questions relating to <strong>data validation</strong> (Question 12a.); in this question students needed to give an example that relates directly to the case study to gain full marks.</p>

      <p class="examiner" > Other areas that should be addressed include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p class="examiner" > When answering a question that asks students to <strong>justify a response</strong>, the response must involve a comparison of the stated option against an alternative option and state why the stated option is preferred (Section B, Question 2c.).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="examiner" > Students should always give an <strong>example that relates to the relevant question</strong> or case study, or they will not be able to obtain full marks (Section C, Questions 4b., 9b., 12 and 13b.).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="examiner" > When quoting <strong>legislation</strong> (Section C, Question 15), such as one of the acts, students must include the <strong>correct year</strong> to receive marks for that component of the question (e.g. Privacy Act 1988).</p>
        </li>
        <li>

      <p class="comment">The examiners are <em>wildly</em> assuming that all students know the format of a mobile phone number. Maybe most students <em>do</em> know - maybe they don't. But exams should not assume knowlege that is beyond the study design. </p>
      <p class="comment"> The exam <em>should</em> have given an <strong>example number</strong> to give students guidance, e.g. '0404 999 444'' to make it clear what the question is trying to examine.</p >
      <p class="explanation">The example data is alphanumeric, since it contains leading zeros and alphabetical data (spaces) as well as numerals. It can only be stored as text/string. </p>
      <p class="explanation">- Boolean can only store true/false values. </p>
      <p class="explanation">- Integer/numeric cannot store spaces, and don't need to be be stored as numbers because no maths wiill be done with the data anyway.</p>

      <p class="explanation">(A) is using <strong>Hungarian Notation</strong> to indicate the field's table as a prefix, as one would do with <strong>staff</strong>ID, <strong>product</strong>ID, <strong>sale</strong>ID etc. The prefix keeps reminding people of what table the ID belongs to.

      <blockquote>
        <p class="explanation"><em>Usability</em> - fine. That is important to functionality. Good so far.</p>
        <p class="explanation"><em>Appearance</em> - Then remember that the question specified that &quot;He is not worried about the appearance of the spreadsheet&quot;. So this option is invalid. </p>
        <p class="explanation">Mentally or physically (during writing time only) cross out option A. <img src="/m/xcross.png" width="30" height="29" alt=""/></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="explanation"><img src="/tip.png" width="40" height="22" alt=""/> Remember that if an option has more than one component (e.g. 'usability <strong>and</strong> appearance') , <strong>all </strong>of the components must be true for the option to be true.</p>
      <p class="explanation"> <strong>B. repetition, colour, proportion, text hierarchy, text style and titles.</strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="explanation">Several components are directly related to appearance.</p>
        <p class="explanation">Put a mental cross (during reading time) or physical cross (during writing time) against this option because it has no redeeming features. <img src="/m/xcross.png" width="30" height="29" alt=""/></p>

        <p class="explanation"><em>Robustness</em> means the solution can withstand unusual and challenging events, and has a low failure rate. e.g. it can cope with huge data sets, and it won't crash if it is fed invalid data. So that aids functionality.</p>
        <p class="explanation"><em>Flexibility</em> means it can be used for a variety of tasks. That certainly aids functionality. Looking good so far.</p>
        <p class="explanation"><em>Navigation</em>. Yeah. Navigation is nice. Being able to get from place to place in a solution is always a good idea. </p>
        <p class="explanation"><em>Error tolerance</em> - humans are notoriously stupid. You know this. Anticipating human stupidity and being able to recover from it is vital to creating a functional solution. e.g. if the user types in &quot;nine&quot; instead of the numeral &quot;9&quot; you don't want the system to crash because of a data type mismatch. A functional system would validate inputs and filter out the human stupidity before it infected the data. Also, systems errors (e.g. power failure, running out of memory, loss of network connection) can be handled gracefully by a solution that functions well.</p>
        <p class="explanation">So - option C deserves a tick. It's good in all its aspects.<img src="/m/xtick.gif" width="29" height="28" alt=""/></p>

        <p class="explanation">Focus on what options C and D do <em>not</em> have in common. <br />
          <em> Repetition</em> and <em>colour</em> are qualities of a solution and may indirectly aid functionality, but they suffer the same fault as option B.<br />
          <em> Ease of use</em> is a good help to functionality, so that's fine.</p>

      <p> The owner of a European car sales company is looking for an effective way to display a list of all cars made after 2020 from either Italy or Germany in their database.<br />
        This query would be written as</p>
      <p> A. Year &lt; 2020 AND (Country = &lsquo;Italy&rsquo; OR Country = &lsquo;Germany&rsquo;).<br />
        B. Year &lt; 2020 AND (Country = &lsquo;Italy&rsquo; AND Country = &lsquo;Germany&rsquo;).<br />
        C. Year &gt; 2020 AND (Country = &lsquo;Italy&rsquo; OR Country = &lsquo;Germany&rsquo;).<br />
        D. Year &gt;= 2020 AND (Country = &lsquo;Italy&rsquo; AND Country = &lsquo;Germany&rsquo;).</p>
      <p class="myanswer">Answer is C.</p>
      <p class="explanation">This is an easy one. Such questions about boundary conditions (where a solution's behaviour should change - a.k.a. 'tipping point') are usually the domain of Software Development but it's relevant to database queries, so I'll allow it. hehehe</p>
      <p class="explanation">A good and knowledgeable student will immediately check which options are impossible. The query wants cars made <strong>after</strong> 2020 and there's only one option that gets that exactly right: C. Don't be sucked in by D which includes cars made <strong>in</strong> andt <strong>after</strong> 2020.</p>
      <p class="explanation">The 'country' part of the equation is a simple choice of AND or OR. Not difficult, even for students of physical education.</p>

      <p class="explanation">This is a simple definition question. Sometimes you will be directly examined on what the study design dictates. </p>
      <p class="explanation"><img src="/m/tip.png" width="40" height="22" alt=""/>You need to toe the line even if you deeply disagree with the study design. e.g. for many years the study design insisted that &quot;ease of use&quot; was an efficiency criterion. I disagreed strongly - for many years - but had to use VCAA's definition when I answered questions. Finally, VCAA retracted their dodgy definition. </p>
      <p class="explanation">The moral is: use VCAA's study design definitions even if you don't agree with them. You will not earn points by arguing the toss during an exam answer.</p>
      <p class="explanation">The study design says (in part)</p>
      <blockquote>

        <p class="explanation"><em>This concept focuses on how hardware and software are used to manage and control access to secure data. Di</em>gital systems form one of the components of an<strong> information system</strong>, along with people, data and processes. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="explanation">And the glossary says a digital system, </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="explanation"><em>Refers to elements such as hardware and software, and their interconnectedness, used to create digital solutions. When digital systems are connected they form a network.</em></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="explanation"><img src="/tip.png" width="40" height="22" alt=""/> If you are aiming for a high score, you must be acquainted with the the VCAA study design. Take what your teacher and textbook says, but - for your own sake - read the study design carefully. Teachers are fallible (yes, true! Shocking news) and textbooks are NOT official - and can be downright bad. I've written five of them, so I know.</p>
      <p class="explanation">Again, take each option in turn and give it a CROSS, QUESTION MARK, or TICK.</p>

      <p> Thanos has been collecting data from her class about the hours that they play online games on the weekend, and she records this in a spreadsheet. The spreadsheet calculates the total hours played on the weekend; however, the spreadsheet does not have data for two members of the class.<br />
        Which aspect of data integrity has been affected?</p>
      <p> A. accuracy<br />
        B. relevance<br />
        C. correctness<br />
        D. reasonableness</p>
      <p class="explanation">The study design (Data Analytics U3O1 KK02) says, &quot;factors influencing the integrity of data, including accuracy, authenticity, correctness, reasonableness, relevance and timeliness&quot;</p>
      <p class="comment">I wish VCAA study design writers would use the <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/what-is-the-oxford-comma-and-why-do-people-care-so-much-about-it/#:~:text=The Oxford (or serial) comma,use while others don't.">Oxford Comma</a>. It greatly reduces the chance of misinterpretation of lists.</p>
      <p class="explanation">Let's start with some dictionary definitions for the options in the question:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="explanation">Accuracy - The quality of being near to the true value. In maths, the number of significant figures given in a number. </li>
        <li class="explanation">Relevance - The relation of something to the matter at hand.<br>
        </li>
        <li class="explanation">Correctness - Conformity to fact or truth.</li>
        <li><span class="explanation">Reasonableness - The quality of being plausible or acceptable to a reasonable person.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="explanation">So, how does missing data affect data integrity? It affects <strong>completeness</strong>, but this is <strong>not</strong> one of the options (but it <em>is</em> listed as a measure of <em>effectiveness</em> in the <a href="/glossary.html#effectiveness">glossary</a>.)</p>
      <p class="explanation">The incomplete data collected by Thanos can still be <em>accurate</em>: she could have a total with 6 decimal places. So that's not a problem.</p>
      <p class="explanation">Thanos' data is certainly still <em>relevant</em>: it relates directly to the topic under discussion, i.e. gaming times on weekends. No problem.</p>
      <p class="explanation">Is her incomplete data <em>correct</em>? Does it reflect true facts? It certainly reflects the true facts of the people who had their data collected.</p>
      <p class="explanation">Most people would consider the incomplete data to be <em>reasonable</em>. If the missing data were somehow wildly unrepresentative (e.g. 'cherry picked' to include or exclude data that went against the experimenter's thesis) then it might be considered unreasonable. But we are not told why that data of two students was absent.</p>
      <p class="explanation">So - what do do? What's the least-worst choice?</p>
      <p class="explanation">Can we easily eliminate options?</p>
      <p class="explanation">B and D are clearly silly. Cross them out.</p>
      <p class="explanation">Accuracy is not really an issue. The data are precise, we assume. </p>
      <p class="explanation">That leaves C. And I would love to hear VCAA justify that choice.</p>

      <p> A team working on a project is having issues finding the correct versions of files that they should be working with, due to inconsistency about where the files have been stored.<br />
        What is an appropriate technique that the team could implement to resolve this issue?</p>
      <p> A. Files are archived regularly.<br />
        B. A backup copy is made of current working files.<br />
        C. A file management plan is created and implemented.<br />
        D. Files are protected from unauthorised users, using two-factor authentication.</p>
      <p class="myanswer">Answer is C.</p>
      <p class="explanation">This is an easy one.</p>
      <p class="explanation">A - archiving improves data security by making a copy of old data and deleting the original. It does not make files easier to find. <img src="/m/xcross.png" width="30" height="29" alt=""/></p>
      <p class="explanation">B - Backups are like archiving, except the original is not deleted.<img src="/m/xcross.png" width="30" height="29" alt=""/></p>
      <p class="explanation">C - A file management plan would include file naming schemes and rules about where files are stored. This is the only option that is relevant.<img src="/m/xtick.gif" width="29" height="28" alt=""/></p>

      <p> A medical company is developing a dynamic data visualisation, analysing the impact of influenza vaccinations on the spread of influenza during the past three years. The company wants to compare trends in Australia and neighbouring Oceanic countries.</p>
      <p> What functionality of the dynamic data visualisation software would best support the most efficient use of the data visualisation?</p>
      <p> A. check boxes to select countries and years<br />
        B. live and continually updating data sources<br />
        C. all charts and information displayed on one interface<br />
        D. a dashboard for each country connected through navigational buttons and a menu</p>
      <p class="myanswer">My answer is D - or A. It all depends on Oceania. <span class="examiner">The examiners said it was A.</span></p>
      <p class="explanation">Alarm bells should be sounding and red flags should be waving in your head when you see trigger words like &quot;<strong>efficiency</strong>&quot; in a question. PAY ATTENTION TO THEM! They will often rule out at least 50% of the options. Scan the options - ALL of the options. Keep EFFICIENCY in mind.</p>
      <p class="explanation"> <img src="/tip.png" width="40" height="22" alt=""/> Be sure to read ALL of the options and don't just choose the first one that looks reasonable!</p>
      <p class="explanation">A. Check boxes are quick to choose between only 3 years. Not so sure about using checkboxes to select a neighbouring Oceanic country, though. How many checkboxes would be needed? I'm not a geography student. The examiners seem to believe I am. I'm confused now. <img src="/m/xqm.png" width="23" height="23" alt=""/></p>
      <p class="explanation">B. That would improve <em>effectiveness</em>, but would not make anything quicker, cheaper or easier. Cross. <img src="/m/xcross.png" width="30" height="29" alt=""/></p>
      <p class="explanation">C. Does this mean that all the data is visible at the same time on one screen? This <em>could</em> be efficient, because all of the data is visible. <img src="/m/xqm.png" width="23" height="23" alt=""/></p>
      <p class="explanation">D. Dashboard? Buttons and menus <em>can</em> aid efficiency, but... dashboard? What does it mean? <img src="/m/xqm.png" width="23" height="23" alt=""/></p>
      <p class="explanation">Option A is possibly appropriate, D is unclear to me, but it <em>does</em> refer to efficient controls.</p>
      <p class="comment">I don't like this question at all. It is too vague, and unfairly assumes knowledge beyond the study design.</p>
      <p class="explanation"><img src="/m/schmacho.jpg" alt="Dog's Breakfast Award" width="98" /></p>
      <p class="explanation">BTW - research shows there are about <strong>14</strong> countries in Oceania. That would be stretching the efficiency of checkboxes, making the menus in option D sound more feasible.</p>
      <p class="explanation">So, in the end, I probably would cross my fingers, curse under my breath, and opt for <strong>D</strong>.</p>

      <p class="comment">I'm calling a foul on this one. Nowhere in the study design are these types of charts named, and therefore they should not be directly examinable.</p>

      <p> DelvrStuff is a new app that allows people to pay for and receive delivery of furniture between sellers and buyers for a small cost.<br />
        DelvrStuff allows the sellers to list items of furniture they want to sell, and it requires them to register their name, email address and their mobile phone number to become a seller.<br />
        DelvrStuff lets buyers look for items of furniture, by searching the items&rsquo; names, their descriptions or their sale prices. Once a buyer has found an item, they can buy it and select the date for delivery. The app then provides the buyer with the set delivery fee amount, the total cost for the transaction, and the date it was bought. The buyer must register to use DelvrStuff by providing their name and delivery address details, including street address, suburb and state.<br />
        Draw a normalised design, to third normal form (3NF), to represent the database structure for this app.</p>

      <p class="explanation">Wow. That's a lot of work for 4 marks!</p>
      <p class="explanation">1. Identify the necesary TABLES.</p>
      <p class="explanation">2. Read the question carefully to find the relevant FIELDS.</p>
      <p class="explanation">3. Add the RELATIONSHIP arrows. It would be wise to add the &quot;1&quot; and &quot;many&quot; (<strong>&infin;</strong>) labels to the ends of the arrows. (I'm not sure how fussy the exam markers were told to be about them. <a href="/mailform.htm">Markers - please anonymously let me know</a>).</p>
      <p class="explanation">4. Use common sense: <strong>always</strong> start <strong>any</strong> database table with an ID field. IT COMPLETELY AVOIDS any possibility of a 2NF failure. I'm perpetually infuriated by exams that test for 2NF failures.</p>
      <p class="explanation"> It's like testing children with, <em>&quot;You are covered with petrol. Do you light the match or not?&quot;</em> </p>
      <p class="explanation">The obvious answer is DON'T COVER YOURSELF WITH PETROL IN THE FIRST PLACE! Creating a unique ID in each table eradicates 2NF problems BEFORE THEY CAN EXIST. </p>
      <p class="explanation"><em>OK. Sorry for shouting. I had a lie down. I feel better now.</em></p>
      <p class="explanation"><img src="/tip.png" width="40" height="22" alt=""/> Note how I included a<strong> TransactionID</strong> field even though it is never used? It's <em>instinct</em>. Make a table - make an ID field. In that order.</p>

Feel satisfied that you brought your wide selection of coloured highlighters. <span class="yellowback">Use them freely</span>. <span class="blueback">Enjoy their power</span>. You <em>will</em> need them for a 'modified Gantt chart' question. And don't get me started on Gantt revision questions in exams, I would need another urgent lie down. I hate them SO much. Gantt charts are done with <em>software</em>. They are <em>not</em> annotated by hand, on paper as in stupid VCAA exam questions. Arghhh! It's so... arghhh!</p>
      <p class="explanation"><em>OK. Where were we?</em></p>
      <p class="explanation">6. Don't be embarrassed to cross out mis-steps (e.g. DeliveryAddress). Just make it clear that you <span class="crossedout">reaslised</span> realised your slip and have fixed it. </p>
      <p class="explanation">The markers will give you a mighty nod and thumbs-up <img src="/thumbsup.gif" width="39" height="43" alt=""/>as they recognise that you saw that something needed to be fixed. </p>

      <p class="explanation">Your sole aim in the exam is to demonstrate your understanding of the key knowledge and key skills. That is all.</p>
      <p class="explanation">7. If you're nervous about creating a database schema (as you should be - it's not a trivial task), sketch out a draft answer on the back page of the exam book. When it looks right, do a proper copy in the provided space after the question. You are not assessed on any preliminary sketches. In fact you'd be mad <em>not</em> to make them. <em>I</em> certainly would sketch it out first.</p>
      <p class="explanation">8. I added a snide remark about the lack of a postcode field in the BUYERS table. This would <em>not</em> earn you bonus marks in a real exam answer. Save your commentary for your online exam post-mortems.</p>
      <p class="explanation">9. When you have finished, READ THE QUESTION AGAIN. Compare it with your answer as if someone (a complete moron) had written it. Actively look for stupid errors and omissions. You can only find your own errors when you assume that they were written by your most stupid worst enemy. </p>
      <p class="explanation"><img src="/tip.png" width="40" height="22" alt=""/> The same applies to proof-reading <em>any</em> of your work throughout your lifetime. <em>Write</em> like you're a majestic queen; but <em>proof-read</em> your writing as if you're your own worst enemy. It's amazing how stupid you can find yourself to be.</p>

    <td valign="top" ><p><strong>Question 2</strong> (6 marks)</p>
      <p> An organisation that promotes healthy eating feels that there is not enough knowledge about the health issues of elderly people related to poor diet and digestion. After collecting and analysing data, the organisation has decided to develop an infographic aimed at educating the elderly about digestive health.</p>
      <p> a. Outline a technique the organisation could use to generate design ideas for the infographic. 1 mark [3 lines]</p>
      <p class="explanation">The study design is not very helpful when it comes to giving examples of&nbsp; techniques to generate design ideas.</p>
      <p class="explanation">It refers to &quot;annotations to indicate key functions and appearance&quot;, and "text and diagrams".&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="explanation">So, I would probably answer:</p>
      <p class="myanswer"> Produce mockups to show how the infographic would look.</p>
      <p class="explanation">I don't know whether other techniques would be relevant, such as </p>
      <p class="explanation">- Brainstorming - get people together to throw around creative ideas without criticism or editing.</p>
      <p class="explanation">Anyway...</p>
      <p class="explanation">The key verb in the question is &quot;outline&quot;. That means a <em>brief</em> overview. </p>
      <p class="explanation">The fact that it's only worth 1 mark reinforces the hint that you should only spend about 1.2 minutes on your answer. </p>
      <p class="explanation">The number of lines provided on the exam paper also gives you a clue about how much detail to include.</p>
      <p class="explanation">As always, don't waste time repeating the answer. Do <strong>not</strong> say, &quot;A technique the organisation could use to generate design ideas for the infographic is...&quot;</p>
      <p class="explanation">Start your answer <strong>after</strong> the word &quot;<strong>is</strong>&quot; </p>
      <p class="examiner">Students were required to outline a technique the organisation could use to generate design ideas for the infographic. The most common responses that gained a mark were: <br />

      <p class="examiner"> 0.5 / 1 = 50%</p>
      <p> b. The organisation will need to consider design principles when designing the infographic.
        Identify and describe one design principle related to appearance that is appropriate for the target audience.	2 marks [5 lines]</p>
      <p class="explanation">The study design sayeth:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="courier">Design principles are accepted characteristics that contribute to the functionality, usability and appearance of solutions. </p>
        <p class="courier">In this study the principles related to usability include ease of use, flexibility and robustness, and accessibility, including navigation and error tolerance. </p>
        <p class="courier"><strong>Design principles related to appearance are alignment, balance, contrast, image use, space, and text and table formatting.</strong></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="explanation"><strong>Key words in the question: </strong><em>Identify and describe one design principle related to appearance that is appropriate for the target audience.</em></p>
      <p class="explanation">Let's unpack that.</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="explanation"><strong class="explanation">ONE</strong> design principle</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="explanation">Not <em>two</em> design principles. Definitely not <em>three</em>. <strong>ONE</strong>. Providing more than one is a waste of time and ink. If you can think of three relevant answers, you must use your judgement to settle on the best one you can come up with. And good judgement is all-important in exams and life in general. I have none, so I know.</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="explanation"> related to <strong>APPEARANCE</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="explanation">It must relate to APPEARANCE, <strong>not</strong> USABILITY. If you mess that up, your <em>brilliant </em>answer may be 100% irrelevant. </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="explanation"><strong class="explanation">appropriate for the target audience</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="explanation">The target audience is elderly. What features of the solution specifically apply to them? Don't give an answer that perfectly suits five-year-old left-handed Italians.</p>
      <p class="explanation">So, you could argue...</p>
      <p class="explanation"><strong>Alignment</strong> - does left/centred/right justified text or images particularly apply to elderly people? Hardly. Skip that.</p>
      <p class="explanation"><strong>Balance</strong> - this refers to having a roughly-equal amount of material on the left and right, top and bottom of the page/screen. So, a big picture may be placed on the left and a lot of text may be put on the right to <em>balance</em> it. For example...</p>
      <p class="explanation"><img src="/m/balance.png" width="510" height="305" alt=""/></p>
      <p class="explanation"><img src="/tip.png" width="40" height="22" alt=""/> Digital mockups often use fake / dummy text that can be pasted in mere seconds and not to distract the viewer from the <em>appearance</em> of the mockup. Typically, the fake text is called 'Lorem Ipsum' consisting of meaningless words adapted from Latin:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="explanation"><em>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.</em></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="explanation">Is balance particularly relevant to elderly people? They sometimes have balance issues, such as tripping over the cat, but balance is not especially important in their infographics.</p>
      <p class="explanation"><strong>Contrast</strong> - Here we go. This is getting juicier. Elderly people's eyes gradually go wonky, especially when reading. Poor contrast - the difference between text and background colours - makes reading even more difficult. This option is a possibility. This option looks good! </p>
      <p class="explanation"><strong>Image use</strong> - Infographics are essentially <strong>graphic</strong>. The use of graphics is mandatory. Graphics are not especially included for old farts.</p>
      <p class="explanation"><strong>Space</strong> - separates nearby items on the printed page or on screen. Space between items makes them more distinct. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <h3 class="explanation">Margins on the edges of a page or screen are important.</h3>
          <h3 class="explanation"> (See what I did with these lines? They stand out.)</h3>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="explanation">Space between paragraphs makes it clear that one topic is changing into a new topic. </p>
      <p class="explanation">The space <em>between</em> lines (called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading#:~:text=In typography, leading (/',the vertical distance between them.">&quot;leading</a>&quot;, pronounced &quot;ledding) &quot; makes text easier to read. Cramming text next to images (or text next to borders) is ugly and hampers readability. But it's not especially relevant to ancient wrinkled readers. </p>
      <p class="explanation"><strong>Text and table formatting</strong> - Umm. You <em>could</em> argue that text formatting is pretty relevant to boomers. Text that is too small is hard for them to read. And we have covered contrast already. </p>
      <p class="explanation"><strong>Serif fonts </strong></p>
      <h1><img src="/m/2023-da-postmortem-b2.png" width="377" height="41" alt=""/></h1>
      <p class="explanation"> are bit easier to read than <strong>sans serif fonts</strong> ('sans' is French for 'without')</p>
      <h1 class="arial">e.g. Arial, as opposed to Times New Roman</h1>
      <p class="explanation">because of the distinctive strokes at the end of their lines, especially for characters like a capital I, and a lowercase L&quot;.</p>
      <p class="comment">Some people say that serif fonts are better printed, and sans serif fonts are better onscreen. Let the debate rage. </p>
      <p class="explanation">But - which to choose for your answer to the exam question? I would opt for <em>contrast</em>.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p class="myanswer"><strong>Contrast: Elderly readers would likely have trouble reading text that is too similar to its background colour. Using contrasting colours for text and background would make the text more readable.</strong></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="explanation">You could even break out your highlighters again to demonstrate your point.</p>

      <hr>
      <p> Two alternative design ideas have been created for the infographic.<img src="/m/da2023-B2c.png" width="878" height="565" alt=""/></p>
      <p class="examiner">One criterion for evaluating the alternative designs is stated below:<br>
        &bull; The infographic should be able to communicate the intended message to the target audience.</p>
      <p class="examiner">To gain full marks, students were required to identify and describe a design principle that was appropriate for the target audience. Acceptable design principles that related to appearance were: alignment, balance, contrast, image use, space, and text and table formatting.</p>
      <p class="examiner">The following is a possible answer. </p>
      <p class="examiner">&quot;The organisation must ensure infographic uses the design principle of contrast. This ensures the elderly population are able to read provided information without difficulty, since infographic elements contrast the background.&quot;</p>
      <p class="examiner"> 1.1 / 2 = 55%</p>
      <p> c. Based on the criterion above, justify which design idea, A or B, would be more appropriate. 3 marks [9 lines]</p>
      <p class="myanswer">I choose A. </p>
      <p class="myanswer">It has 6 images, compared with B's 2, and the value of infographics is based on their use of imagery to convey information quickly and clearly. </p>
      <p class="myanswer">B contains too much text to be quickly and easily absorbed, and the text is much smaller in size than option A, making it harder for elderly people (the target audience) to read..</p>
      <p class="examiner">When a question asks you to &quot;justify&quot;, it wants you to give good reasons to support your opinion.</p>
      <p class="examiner">Students were required to justify which design idea would be more appropriate. Only Design A was accepted; students did not gain any marks if they suggested Design B. <br />
        To gain full marks, students needed to select Design A, state a reason why it should be chosen and then state a reason why Design B would not be appropriate. <br />
        Common responses for choosing Design A were large text and more images; common responses for not choosing Design B were small text and small graphs. <br />
        The following is an example of a high-scoring response. <br />
        Design A is more appropriate because it contains a large font size which ensures elderly people who have poor vision to easily read and thus understand the intended message. Design B is not appropriate because it contains many large blocks of text with small font sizes which makes it harder to read and interpret its message for elderly people who may have vision problems.</p>

      <p class="examiner">To gain full marks, students needed to explain the difference between navigation and error tolerance. <br>
        While many students could describe what navigation was, most struggled with error tolerance. Navigation refers to the ease with which a user can move through the interface of a data analytics tool to access the features and functions they need. This includes things like the layout of the interface, the placement of menus and buttons, and the organisation of data and analysis results. <br>
        Error tolerance refers to the ability of a data analytics tool to handle mistakes made by the user. This includes things like providing helpful error messages, allowing users to undo or redo actions, and preventing users from making errors in the first place. <br>

        Navigation is the ability to manoeuver from one area of the dynamic data visualisation to another. Error tolerance however is related to how the visualisation manages errors, this tolerance is evident when it displays warning messages instead of shutting down completely.</p>

    <td valign="top" ><p><strong>Question 4</strong> (6 marks)</p>
      <p> Marina and Parth run an online business that allows people to buy and sell old sneakers and clothes. The data from their business is stored in a database that is hosted on a server in their office. A full backup of their business data is performed at the start of each month, and a differential backup is performed each week on Friday night. All backups are stored on an external hard disk drive (HDD) located in the office. The backups are regularly tested, and all backups are created successfully.</p>
      <p> a. If the server had a hard drive failure, what is the maximum number of days of data that will be lost if the database needs to be restored from backup? Explain your answer.	2 marks [4 lines]</p>
      <p class="myanswer">The last <em>full</em> backup would restore data to its state at the start of the current month. </p>
      <p class="myanswer">The weekly <em>differential</em> backups would include data added or changed in each of the past weeks.</p>
      <p class="myanswer">The worst case would be a failure on a Friday afternoon, <em>before</em> the differential backup on Friday night. </p>
      <p class="myanswer">That would lose all new data after the previous Friday night backup, which is nearly SEVEN full days. </p>
      <p class="comment">But, seriously folks. Second-hand shoes and clothes? Who cares about data like that? I doubt their business would last a full month, so backups would be a waste of time. Anyways...</p>
      <p class="examiner">Students were required to work out the maximum number of days that data would be lost, if the data were to be recovered from a differential backup. <br>
        As the differential backup occurred once a week on Friday night, there is the possibility that one whole week&rsquo;s data will be lost if a disaster occurred on Friday night just prior to the backup being created. Therefore, seven days&rsquo; worth of data could be lost. One mark was awarded for stating seven days and one mark for an explanation of what a differential backup is. <br>
        A large number of students seem to have confused an incremental backup with a differential backup and therefore did not obtain full marks. <br>
        An incremental backup only copies modified data since the last backup. For example, if you took a full backup on Friday, your incremental backup on Saturday would only copy changes since the Friday backup. On Sunday, it would only copy changes to the backup image file since the Saturday backup. <br>
        A differential backup strategy copies only newly added and changed data since the last full backup. If your last full backup was on Friday, a backup on Saturday would copy all changes since Friday. If you took another backup on Tuesday, it would also copy all changes from Friday. The backup file size would increase progressively until the next full backup.</p>
      <p class="examiner"> 1 / 2 = 50% </p>
      <p>b. Suggest and justify<strong> two</strong> changes to the backing up strategy to improve data protection and the ability to recover from a disaster.	4 marks [7 lines]</p>
      <p class="myanswer">1. Continuous, automatic backups to the cloud. Every data change would be stored offsite immediately, and would be protected against local disasters or failures. This is by far the best option.</p>
      <p class="myanswer">2. Weekly full backups and daily incremental backups. Data that has been created or changed since the last full backup is saved daily. So the backups are small and fast and would only lose one day's data in a worst-case scenario. </p>
      <p class="comment">&quot;Marina and Parth&quot; - groan. Even the multicultural naming people in the VCAA basement must be getting sick of this desperate inclusivity by now.</p>
      <p class="explanation">Again - only give TWO changes. Not 1. Not 3. Five is <em>right out</em>.</p>
      <p class="explanation">It's like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOrgLj9lOwk">Holy Hand Grenade</a>.</p>
      <p class="examiner">Students were asked to suggest and justify two changes to the backing up strategy to improve data protection and the ability to recover from a disaster. <br>
        The majority of students were able to suggest at least one change to the backing up strategy. <br>
        Marks were awarded for identifying an improvement in the categories of: <br>
        &bull; types of backups <br>
        &bull; location of backups <br>
        &bull; media used for backups <br>
        &bull; frequency of backups. <br>
        To obtain full marks, answers needed to compare current vs suggested for two categories; responses needed to be from different categories, not from the same category. <br>
        The following are examples of high-scoring responses. <br>
        Example 1 <br>
        Instead of storing the backups at on-site locations through HDD&rsquo;s, store backups through cloud storage to ensure that the data backed up is located off-site and is not susceptible to local threats (e.g. Fire at business) <br>
        Example 2 <br>
        Instead of conducting a weekly differential backup and a monthly full backup, conduct a weekly full back up and a daily incremental backup to ensure that in the event of threats such as a hard drive failure, data loss is minimised compared to the previous strategy.</p>

      <p>A large Australian multinational company, Grains4Food produces wheat, barley, oats and other grains. Grains4Food have offices throughout Australia and have decided that they need to build a new grain processing facility to support their three farm regions, region 1, region 2 and region 3. They believe this will help them add value to their products and improve their profits.</p>
      <p> Ali leads data analytics at the company and has been given the task of developing a dynamic data visualisation by Sara, the CEO of the company. This dynamic data visualisation will be used by Sara and the Board of Directors of Grains4Food to help determine the best location for the new grain processing facility.</p>
      <p> Sara has employed two full-time staff to join the team for the project, which needs to be completed by 8 December. Sara, along with the Board, needs to easily use and review the dynamic data visualisation to help determine the feasibility of the grain processing facility proposal. Ali has been asked to present the dynamic data visualisation so that it can be viewed through a browser, and not through a data visualisation application.</p>
      <p> Ali will need to make sure that the dynamic data visualisation represents information for each region and covers factors such as population, climate and grain production for each of the three regions for the past five years. Sara has decided that wheat will be the only grain that will be processed at the new facility.</p>
      <p> Ali&rsquo;s team have decided on the tasks that need to be completed to make sure that they can present the dynamic data visualisation to the Board on 8 December. The team do not work on weekends. However, team members can work on different tasks at the same time. Part of the team will work with primary data and the rest of the team will work with secondary data. The tasks, durations and dependencies that have been decided are shown in Table 1. The project must begin on 13 November and the handover to the design team must be completed by 28 November. </p>
      <p><img src="/m/da2023-c-table1.png" width="805" height="525" alt=""/></p>
      <p>Ali has requested data from the Grains4Food farm management unit as an initial starting point for his team&rsquo;s research. He has been sent seven years of data from all five regions of different grain production throughout Australia. </p>
      <p>Ali has also downloaded rainfall data from the weather bureau website for each of the regions for a period of 10 years to use in the dynamic data visualisation. Table 2 lists a sample of the data for Region 3 from this data set.</p>

      <p class="explanation">OK. Let's begin.</p>
      <p class="explanation"><strong>Task 1</strong>. Five days, no dependencies. Colour in from the 13th to the 17th - five days. Easy. And colouring-in is s<em>till</em> fun when you're 16 or 66.</p>
      <p class="explanation"><strong>Task 2</strong> - One day, dependent on Task 1. So it must start one <strong>working day</strong> after task 1 - the 20th. <br>
        It <strong>cannot</strong> start on Saturday 18th because that's <strong>not a working day</strong>. The case study's rules say so.<br>
        Colour in Monday 20th. <br>
        Add the dependency arrow from the end of task 1 to the top of task 2. <br>
        Sweet. We're doing well, and the colour scheme is <em>so</em> pretty.</p>
      <p class="explanation"><strong>Task 3</strong> - One day long, dependent on task 2 finishing first. Basically the same as we did for task 2. We're doing well.</p>
      <p class="explanation"><strong>Task 4</strong> - <em>And this is where the wheels start to fall off</em>.</p>
      <p class="explanation">Five days' duration, dependent on task 3. <br>
        We colour this in - from Wed 22nd for five<strong> working days</strong>. We skip the weekend of the 25th and 26th, as the rules say we must. <br>
        So, task 4 ends on <strong>Tue 28th</strong>.</p>
      <p class="explanation">You might be thinking, &quot;Something is going wrong here... there are six tasks to go, and we're already on the last day allowed for the project? What the...?&quot;</p>
      <p class="explanation">Grit your teeth and forge ahead regardless.</p>
      <p class="explanation"><strong>Task 5</strong> - What?? A one-day task <strong>dependent on task 4</strong>? <br>
        That means it must start on the <strong>29th</strong>, which is <strong>outside of the parameters of the project</strong>.<br>
        It can't be drawn in without going outside of the chart provided.<br>
        So, I coloured in the margin of the paper. Best I could do. </p>
      <p class="explanation"><strong>Task 6</strong> - Is just impossible. <br>
        It's a milestone event (zero duration, no work needed for it), but it's dependent on task 5. <br>
        That takes us well off the paper provided in the exam book. <br>
        It cannot be represented. This is a disaster.</p>
      <p class="explanation">&quot;OK,&quot; you say to yourself. &quot;This is a mess, but I'll do what I can. Let's go on.&quot;</p>
      <p class="explanation"><strong>Task 7</strong> - Some relief here. No dependencies, so it can start back on the 13th, goes for 5 days. Easy.</p>
      <p class="explanation"><strong>Task 8</strong> - Two days long, dependent on task 7. <br>
        We must skip over the weekend, so it goes from the 20th to the 21st. <br>
        Add the cute dependency arrow from task 7 to this task.</p>
      <p class="explanation"><strong>Task 9</strong> - A milestone that occurs after task 8 has finished. <br>
        Fill it in with the traditional diamond milestone marker on the 22nd and add the dependency arrow.</p>
      <p class="explanation"><strong>Task 10</strong> - This is impossible. <br>
        It's another milestone. <br>
        It's dependent on task 9 (which is easy), but it's also dependent on task 6, which has already shown itself to be impossible. <strong><br>
        It cannot be represented.</strong></p>

        A large number of students did not correctly draw the dependencies or the milestones and this resulted in them not being awarded a mark for that task. Students needed to start at the end of the last task and go to the start of the next task and through the milestone when drawing the dependencies. Marks were not awarded if the line for the dependencies either started or finished in the middle of the task. Milestones needed to be on the line (start of the day that the milestone relates to).</p>

      <p class="myanswer">7,8</p>
      <p class="explanation">That is all you need to say. (It helps you claw back the time you wasted trying to sort out C2a.)</p>
      <p class="explanation">But here's the long story.</p>
      <p class="explanation">The critical path is the sequence of tasks from the start to the end of the project that cannot have their durations changed without affecting the end date of the project.</p>
      <p class="explanation">The length of the critical path is the shortest possible amount of time needed to finish <em>all </em>tasks.</p>
      <p class="explanation">It is also, somewhat oddly, the <em>longest</em> time required to finish all tasks.</p>
      <p class="explanation">Any task that can have its duration changed without affecting the end date of the project is <em>not</em> on the critical path.</p>
      <p class="explanation">So, in this case, the critical path would be tasks: 1.2.3.4.5. </p>
      <p class="explanation">Milestones are not counted as tasks because they are <strong>events</strong> - they just <em>happen</em> with no labour required.</p>
      <p class="explanation">Task 7 could, in theory, blow out 14 more days before it affected the end date of the project. </p>
      <p class="explanation">Task 8 could go 5 working days past its planned deadline before it messed with the ending date. This amount of potential 'overtime' for a task is called <em>slack</em>.</p>
      <p class="explanation">No task on the critical path can, by definition, have any slack.</p>
      <p class="examiner">Students were asked to list the tasks not included in the critical path. Responses that obtained the mark were Tasks 7 and 8. These two tasks can be delayed or take longer to complete and will not affect the end dates of the project. Task 9 was also accepted. Although it is a milestone, it is listed as a task and therefore could be included.</p>

      <p class="explanation">That should do it. </p>
      <p class="explanation"><img src="/tip.png" width="40" height="22" alt=""/> Be wary of using jargon in your answers without making it very clear to the marker that you know what the jargon means.</p>
      <p class="explanation">Simply saying, &quot;They have slack&quot; <em>may</em> be the sign that you have memorised a definition without the slightest inkling of what it means. </p>
      <p class="explanation">You are being assessed on demonstrated <em>understanding</em> of the subject matter. You are <strong>not</strong> being marked on how well you can recite memorised definitions.</p>
      <p class="examiner">Students were asked to explain why the tasks from Question 2a. were not included. <br>
        One mark was awarded for stating that the tasks can be delayed or take longer to complete and one mark was awarded for stating that the tasks will not affect the end date of the project. Students who mentioned slack time in the correct phrase were awarded a mark. <br>
        The following is an example of a high-scoring response. <br>
        These tasks do not contribute to the longest path without any slack time. Both 7 and 8 can be delayed without impacting the final collation date.</p>

        <li> whether they would like to be contacted about this survey. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>On the grid below, create a design of a form for the survey that can be viewed as an input form, with appropriate form elements labelled to support efficient and effective collection of data. </p>
      <hr>
      <p class="explanation">This is not as easy as it used to be in the good old days before smartphones. All designs before the advent of smartphones were clearly meant to suit computer monitors which were wider than they were tall (and still are). That is <em>landscape</em> orientation.</p>
      <p class="explanation"><img src="/p/2023-da-postmortem/c2b-landscape.jpg" width="800" height="396" alt="Horizontal orientation"/></p>
      <p class="explanation">But phones and tablets tend to be used in <em>portrait</em> mode so their displays are usually taller than they are wide. </p>
      <p class="explanation"><img src="/p/2023-da-postmortem/c2b-portrait.jpg" width="360" height="800" alt="Vertical orientation"/></p>
      <p class="explanation">But not <em>always</em>. Phone displays can usually (but not always, depending on your settings) be rotated, and the display can adjust itself to the new orientation</p>
      <p class="explanation">The question does not say what sort of device on which the form will be viewed and used. So - should you design a landscape or portrait oriented input form? Or both?</p>
      <p class="explanation">So you read the case study again... but it does not give a clue. Its grid is neither horizontal nor vertical: it's <strong>square</strong>, with a ratio of 1 to 0.99. </p>
      <p class="explanation">Like NO display device ever created by man, woman, or goat...</p>
      <p><img src="/m/da2023-c3.png" width="225" height="230" alt=""/></p>
      <p class="explanation">So. What to do? </p>
      <p class="explanation"><img src="/tip.png" width="40" height="22" alt=""/> Unless you're very brave, use pencils for this type of question. Ink is <em>really</em> hard to rub out when you screw the pooch. Also, you will need a variety of pencil colours, for design reasons.</p>
      <p class="explanation"><img src="/tip.png" width="40" height="22" alt=""/> Remember the hint in the instructions: &quot;The survey data will be collected once the &lsquo;Submit&rsquo; button is pressed&quot; - so, for dog's sake, don't forget to include a SUBMIT button in your design!</p>
      <p class="explanation">Let's take things one at a time. Let's consider what sort of <strong>controls</strong> to use for data entry. They need to be efficient and effective.</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="explanation"><strong>Name</strong> - must be a text box. A drop-down list is really <em>not</em> going to work.</li>
        <li class="explanation"><strong>Email</strong> - again, text.</li>
        <li class="explanation"><strong>Region</strong> - Hmmm. Is there a limited list of acceptable regions? Check the case study again (and do it whenever in doubt). Yep - <strong>three</strong> regions, cunningly named 1, 2 and 3. It is always best to minimise the chance of invalid data entry by restricting the available options.
          <ul>
            <li>Text entry would be unwise - people could enter &quot;3&quot;, &quot;three&quot;, &quot;my region&quot; etc. So, a text box is not good. </li>
            <li>A drop-down list is possible, but for only 3 options it's probably overkill. </li>
            <li>Checkboxes won't suit because you don't want people entering zero or multiple options. </li>
            <li>So - radio buttons will do the job nicely. One, and only one option can be selected from a list of 3. Sweet. This is fun. (Assuming you like data entry control fun).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="explanation"><strong>Farmer or community member?</strong> - Let's skate over the quibble that people will be both farmers <em>and</em> community members. Remember the words of wisdom: work out what the examiners were probably <em>trying </em>to say. So it's a 50/50, true/false, yes/no sort of answer. What control is most efficient (easiest to use) and best to use (in terms of enforcing valid inputs)? Radio buttons again. A drop-down list is, again, excessive. Let's quietly ignore the options of checkboxes which would let 100% of farmers identify themselves as both options. Grrr. Bad question. Bad! </li>
        <li><span class="explanation"><strong>Grains produced</strong> - it's a limited list of 4 options.<br>
          But - and this is a BIG 'but' - should suburban students be expected to know whether farmers produce only <strong>one</strong> type of grain? Or more than one? </span>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="explanation">If, in <strong>The Real World </strong>&trade;, grain farmers only produced <em>one</em> grain (e.g. wheat), the best control would be radio buttons - one and only one choice.<br>
              If, however, they produced <em>more</em> than one grain, the control must be checkboxes - zero or multiple choices.</span></li>
            <li><span class="explanation">I lived on a dairy farm in the 1980s and know <strong>for sure</strong> that the farm produced more than one grain.<br>
              Should students be tutored to become familiar with typical modern agricultural practices? &quot;G'day kids. Take your seats. Today we're going to cover Gantt charts, and grain production in the Mallee! Get out your highlighters and tractors.&quot;<br>
              Once again, the examiners are assuming knowledge that is beyond the scope of the study design and they should be smacked on their bottoms.<br>
              So, let's use the common sense (which the exam writers did <em>not </em>use) and opt for - checkboxes. This allows for the selection of multiple grains. <br>
              The reason: even IF most farmers
              only grow one grain, we must allow for those who grow <em>more</em> than one. <br>

      <p> Grains4Food wants to provide farmers with temperature and rainfall sensors to collect data from the farms. The farmer will upload the data from these sensors onto a computer on the farm's network and then send the data to Grains4Food using their internet connection.<br />
      </p>
      <p>Identify and explain the purpose of two network components that the farmers need to have so they can send the temperature and rainfall data to Grains4Food.</p>
      <p class="comment">This is <strong>too</strong> vague. There are various acceptable options, depending on the internet provision and the local networks. Possibilities include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="explanation">modem (ADSL? VDSL? VDSL2? Fibre? Even ancient <strong>dial up</strong>, for dog's sake?)</li>
        <li class="explanation">WAP (wireless access point) if the sensors are wireless. We don't know. the case study didn't say. Maybe they're Bluetooth and need a Bluetooth receiver.Who knows?</li>
        <li class="explanation">satellite dish - not common for suburban students, but normal for remote farms. </li>
        <li class="explanation">router - unless the farmer has a gateway with a router built in. Again, hard to say.</li>
        <li class="explanation">gateway (modem + router in one unit) - often also with a switch and WAP</li>
        <li class="explanation">switch - to provide multiple network outlet cables from a single input. Unless their gateway has a switch in it, which many do.</li>
        <li class="explanation">NBN FTTC connection device - for farms near NBN fibre routes</li>
        <li class="explanation">network interface card (NIC)? Most modern motherboards have an inbuilt NIC.</li>
        <li class="explanation">CAT cable? Yep. It could be that simple. </li>
        <li class="explanation">a cheap smart phone that can receive Bluetooth data from the sensors and then send emails or connect to a website to deliver the sensor data to Grains4Food? </li>

      <p class="explanation">So, let's reduce ourselves to thinking like an exam writer. This is not pleasant, I know: I have written many exams, and it is not nice to have to think like I do. Ask my mum.</p>
      <p><span class="explanation">What were they (probably) <em>confidently</em> expecting the average competent student to say? Let's not overthink it.</span><br />

      <p class="myanswer">Receive and transmit data to and from the internet service provider, and then to/from Grains4Food.<br />
      </p>
      <p>Network component 2</p>
      <p class="myanswer">Network interface card</p>
      <p>Purpose of network component 2</p>
      <p class="myanswer">Allows the computer to send and receive data from other networked devices (such as the modem).</p>
      <p class="explanation">I mean - honestly - I can't think of <em>any</em> other network device that <em>must</em> apply to ANY and ALL farmers. </p>
      <p class="explanation">The markers may think, &quot;What? But a NIC is <em>so</em> basic... Surely it can't be that. I was thinking it <em>should</em> be...&quot; </p>
      <p class="explanation">Yes - but a NIC<strong> is</strong> a vital network device (often overlooked nowadays because it's usually incorporated invisibly into motherboards with only an RJ45 ('Ethernet') port to show for its existence) but it's still crucial to connect to a local area network.</p>

        Network items that were accepted: modem, router, switch, WAP, NIC and computer/notebook. <br>
        Several students were awarded one mark for identifying the network item but could not correctly describe its purpose. This was particularly the case when identifying a router. The purpose of a router is to connect two networks together e.g. a LAN to the internet.</p>

      <p> The primary data collected at the farms needs to be securely sent back to Grains4Food.</p>
      <p> <strong>a</strong>.	Explain how a software security control can be used to protect the data as it is sent.	2 marks [5 lines]</p>
      <p class="explanation">Key word 1: <em>software</em>. Not hardware.</p>
      <p class="explanation">Keyword 2: <em>as it is sent</em>. Not when it is <em>stored</em>.</p>
      <p class="myanswer">TLS (Transport Layer Security) which replaced the older SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encrypts data in transit. </p>
      <p class="myanswer">If the data is intercepted during transfer, it is (effectively) unreadable. </p>
      <p class="myanswer">Only the authorised recipient has been given the unique decryption key.</p>
      <p class="explanation">Note - I didn't just say &quot;Use SSL/TLS.&quot;</p>
      <p class="explanation">1. The question asked me to <em>explain</em>, which requires an explanation of the choice I made. Simply naming stuff is not good enough.</p>
      <p class="explanation">2. As noted above, simply spouting jargon and acronyms does not show you have done anything more than memorise letters that apply to a certain type of question. <strong>Prove</strong> your understanding. </p>
      <p class="examiner">To gain marks, students were required to give an example of how a software security control could be used to protect the data as it is sent. <br>
        Software security controls that gained marks were encryption, HTTPS or SSL. A common response for how the control could protect the data was &lsquo;stops third parties gaining access while being sent&rsquo;. <br>
        Students who named a firewall as the security control were not awarded any marks as the key to this question was the words &lsquo;as it is sent&rsquo;. <br>
        The following is an example of a high-scoring response. <br>
        They can use encryption on the primary data collected to Grains4Food to ensure that even if the data is intercepted when sent the hackers will not be able to access the data.</p>

      <p> Advantage [ 2 lines]</p>
      <p class="myanswer">The data stored on the NAS is shared by, and available to, all authorised users on the LAN. This lets everyone share a single, central, authentic copy of the data.</p>
      <p> Disadvantage [ 2 lines]</p>
      <p class="myanswer">If the NAS fails, the only source of authentic data may be lost, unless it's backed up. </p>
      <p class="myanswer">(Using a RAID array minimises the risk of loss through a single disk's failure.) </p>
      <p class="explanation">or</p>
      <p class="myanswer">Expense - a NAS is not cheap, and filling it with large-capacity high-quality hard disks is very expensive.</p>
      <p><span class="explanation">Yes, the RAID comment is included to be risky. </span><span class="explanation">It really <em>is</em> relevant - sort of, vaguely - but it <em>is</em> also a bit like showing off. Now is <em>not</em> the time to indulge in your personal pet topics. (I, for example, love NAS. I have a NAS that I like to talk about at parties. Which explains why I don't get invited to parties. But anyway, it's a purebred Synology DS418 with four 12TB drives configured as RAID5. His name is Norbert...</span></p>
      <p><span class="explanation">Anyway, you have better things to worry about right now - like C7.</span></p>
      <p class="explanation"><img src="/tip.png" width="40" height="22" alt=""/> There is always the temptation to show you know more than what you were asked. You do not get marks for that. You just use up valuable exam time, and ink.</p>
      <p class="explanation">Gird your loins, answer the question that was asked. Then move on.</p>
      <p class="explanation"> If you have the luxury of spare time when you finish the exam, consider enhancing previous answers with your bonus wisdom - but only if it is relevant to the question.</p>
      <p class="explanation">If you add layers of irrelevant blather to good answers, you risk looking like you didn't know what the question actually was asking - and that may harm you.</p>
      <p class="explanation">e.g. </p>
      <p class="explanation">Q. Why are cats good pets?</p>
      <p class="explanation">A. They purr and catch mice. (FULL MARKS)</p>
      <p class="explanation">Late addition: But cats aren't as good as otters, which love to swim. (The marker starts to have doubts about your ability to read a question.)<br />
      </p>
      <p class="explanation">P.S. While the NAS is a <em>very</em> specific piece of network hardware, it is good to see that it <strong>is</strong> named in the study design's key knowledge (U4O2 KK05). Good examiners!</p>
      <p class="examiner">Students were required to state one advantage and one disadvantage of using a &lsquo;network attached storage&rsquo; device. <br>
        It was clear from the responses that a number of students didn&rsquo;t know what a &lsquo;network attached storage&rsquo; device was and therefore did not gain any marks. </p>
      <p class="myanswer">(cough) <a href="/s/storage-nas-cloud.pptx">WATCH THIS SLIDESHOW</a></p>
      <p class="examiner">The most common acceptable responses for an advantage were: </p>
      <p class="examiner">&bull; fast storage and retrieval as data is local <br>
        &bull; large capacity for files <br>
        &bull; storage space can be expanded by adding new drives or expansion bays <br>
        &bull; data is easier to manage/secure/dispose of as it&rsquo;s stored in one place <br>
        &bull; data is not stored on the local computer <br>
        &bull; can be accessed by anyone with access on the network. </p>
      <p class="examiner">The most common acceptable responses for a disadvantage were: </p>
      <p class="examiner">&bull; as the number of users increases, a large increase in traffic over the LAN may slow performance <br>
        &bull; data needs to be backed up as it is stored in one location on site <span class="comment">(True: don't treat a NAS a backup device. It's a primary storage device)</span><br>
        &bull; if security measures fail, an attacker gains access to all data <br>
        &bull; devices that support faster storage mediums like SSD are significantly more expensive <br>
        &bull; all in one place if something goes wrong &ndash; data lost <br>
        &bull; need someone with technical knowledge to maintain it <br>
        &bull; expensive to set up <br>
        &bull; not portable <span class="comment">(I disagree: a NAS <strong>is</strong> very portable. It just takes a minute to map it on any computer. I know. I have one.)</span></p>

        All the data for the years that are being included are required in the spreadsheet with no blank cells.<br />
        A sample of a section of this spreadsheet is shown in Table 2 in the case study.<br />

        Marks were awarded for each technique (one mark x 2) and for the application of the technique in relation to the case study (one mark x 2). <br />
        There are three acceptable validation techniques: range check, data type check and existence check. <br />
        Students needed to identify one of the three acceptable validation techniques and then give an example that related to the case study to gain a mark per technique. <br />
        The most common accepted responses were: <br />
        &bull; data type check: Rainfall values for each month need to be set with numeric data type as they will be used for calculations <br />
        &bull; range check: Year &gt;= 2018 and &lt;=2022. This will check that the year levels are within the acceptable values for the project.</p>

      <p class="explanation"><em>Annual total (mm) </em>is the <strong>only</strong> calculated value in the spreadsheet. It's the only value that <strong>can</strong> be tested.</p>

      <p> Ali imports the prepared spreadsheet data for rainfall into the data visualisation software.</p>
      <p> <strong>a.</strong> Identify and outline one format and one convention that could be applied to produce a data visualisation that would be the most effective in showing the comparison of annual rainfall for the three regions for the past five years.	2 marks</p>
      <p><img src="/m/tip.png" width="40" height="22" alt=""/> <span class="explanation">Are your mental alarm bells going off? They should have detected the word &quot;effective&quot;.</span> <span class="explanation">Also, the word &quot;one&quot; should be foremost in your noggin.</span></p>
      <p class="explanation">Also, note that you need to (a) identify and (b) outline the format and convention. <em>Two</em> things to do. Forget one, and you lose marks.</p>
      <p> Format [2 marks, 3 lines]</p>
      <p class="myanswer">A line graph / chart with 3 lines showing the rainfall (vertical axis) for the 3 regions over the 5 years (horizontal axis).</p>
      <p> Convention [2 marks, 3 lines]</p>
      <p class="myanswer">Use different coloured lines for the 3 regions. This makes each region identifiable.</p>
      <p>or</p>
      <p class="myanswer">Label the axes to indicate the quantity of the variables (rainfall, year).</p>
      <p class="explanation">OK. <strong>Theory time</strong> Everyone go &quot;Yay!&quot;.</p>
      <p class="explanation"> What? Nobody? Sigh.</p>
      <p class="explanation">A <strong>format</strong> is a chosen method of presenting data or information. It is the vehicle, so to speak, to carry the conveyed information. Formats include text, picture, graph, animation, webpage, slideshow, music, morse code, etc.</p>
      <p class="explanation">A <strong>convention</strong> is a standard, accepted rule or guideline that should be used once a format has been chosen. e.g. once you decide to present data in a graph, there are standard practices to producing a good graph, such as labelled axes.</p>
      <p class="examiner">Students were asked to identify and outline one format and one convention that could be applied to produce an effective data visualisation. They needed to identify a line chart/graph as the format and outline how it was effective as well as identify a convention relating to the graph (axis title, chart title, scale or legend) and an effective reason for using the conventions.<br />
        Many students seemed confused between formats and conventions for spreadsheets and a data visualisation, and as a result did not obtain marks for this question. <br />
        Marks were awarded for format and reason (one mark) and convention and reason (one mark). <br />
        Students who identified a bar or column chart as a format did not gain any marks for this section.<br />
        A number of students obtained a mark for the convention but could not obtain the mark for format. Others did not give a detailed enough reason for both the format or conventions and did not gain any marks. <br />
        The following is an example of a high-scoring response. <br />
        - 
        Format: Line Chart &ndash; can display the data for annual rainfall in the different regions over 5 years in a graphical manner. <br />
        - 
        Convention: Large, bold heading clearly states what the graph is about in a reasonable manner that is easy to understand.</p>

      <p><br />
        <strong>b. </strong>Explain why your selected format is preferred to educate the target audience.	2 marks [3 lines]</p>
      <p class="myanswer">It is pictorial, which suits a data visualisation. It is quick and easy for non-specialists to interpret, and would have a greater impact on them. It also condenses a lot of detailed data into a small space.</p>
      <p class="examiner">To gain marks, students needed to explain why the selected format is preferred to educate the target audience. Responses needed to state that the line chart showed changes over time (one mark) and that it involves a trend/pattern and/or compares data over time (one mark). <br>
        Most students did not mention change over time or a trend/pattern and therefore did not gain any marks for this question. <br>
        The following is an example of a high-scoring response: <br>
        - 
        It clearly displays any trend within the data while allowing for comparison to be made between the regions.</p>

        <strong>c.</strong> Outline a feature that could be added to your selected format in order to create a dynamic display of the comparison of annual rainfall for the three regions.	2 marks</p>
      <p class="explanation">A <strong>dynamic</strong> display of a graph is possible. It means that that graph constantly refreshes itself as the data changes in real time. <br>
        So, in this case, the data visualisation would magically change the graph to show the data added at the end of each month... assuming the audience would be sitting there, watching it for months at a time.</p>
      <p class="explanation">I can't really think of an answer to this, apart from a trivial <strong>animation</strong>, such as...</p>
      <p class="myanswer">Animate the graph lines so they gradually appear month by month across the graph.</p>
      <p class="explanation">or</p>
      <p class="myanswer">Animate the graph so the 3 regions' lines appear one after the other, in order from lowest rainfall to highest rainfall.</p>

      <p> Ali has completed the project and wants to assess the effectiveness of the project plan in managing the project.<br />
        Propose two measurable factors and discuss how they could have contributed to the effectiveness of the project plan.<br />

      <p class="myanswer">Project completion rate </p>

      <p class="myanswer">How often and accurately did the project plan's milestones match actual task deadlines? </p>

      <p> Factor 2 [1 line]</p>
      <p class="myanswer">Error rate</p>
      <p> Discussion [4 lines]</p>
      <p class="myanswer">If a timeline led to tasks failing, being left incomplete, or causing staff unhappiness - the predicted schedule was proably ineffective.</p>
      <p class="explanation">Wow. Those 'discussion' questions ask for a lot of writing for one mark each.</p>
      <p class="explanation">I really have no idea what the examiners were expecting me to say. So I had to resort to using Common Sense &trade; instead.</p>
      <p class="explanation">- Another factor might possibly have been whether tasks were finished within their allocated <strong>budget</strong>, but Gantt charts don't tend to pay much attention to specifiying the cost of tasks.</p>
      <p class="explanation">- Also, <strong>client satisfaction</strong> might be a factor. If the project plan did not lead to the client being satisfied with the results, a bad project plan might have contributed to the problem. </p>
      <p class="explanation">- <strong>Scope</strong> might be a factor. Did the finished project successfully accomplish <strong>all</strong> of the tasks that were actually necessary, or were vital tasks left out? </p>
      <p class="examiner">To gain marks, students needed to propose two measurable factors and discuss how each factor could have contributed to the effectiveness of the project plan. <br>
        To obtain marks, responses needed to include two effectiveness terms (completeness, accuracy, maintainability and readability). The response then needed to link these terms to the project plan and explain how it would be assessed. <br>
        Acceptable higher-scoring responses were similar to: <br>
        &bull; Completeness: were any significant tasks omitted from the project workflow? If any tasks were not included in the project plan, then this would have affected meeting the project due date with all deliverables. <br>
        &bull; Accuracy: were tasks durations accurate? If durations were underestimated, then the project would have not run to time and the plan would not be effective. <br>
        &bull; Maintainability: how easy was it to modify the Gantt chart? If the Gantt chart was difficult to modify, then it probably wasn&rsquo;t going to assist in the management of the project. <br>
        &bull; Readability: was it easy to see all tasks and their dependencies? If the chart was difficult to read, then it would not assist in meeting the project deadline.</p>

      <p class="examiner">Students needed to state if they should be worried about a particular statement and in doing so include any relevant legal issues. <br>
        Marks were awarded for: <br>
        &bull; stating that Sara should be concerned as it is breaking the Privacy Act 1988 (must include correct year) <br>
        &bull; identifying the Australian Privacy Principle that it relates to (does not have to list the number) <br>
        The two principles that apply to this question are that the entity can only use or disclose personal data for the purpose for which it was collected unless the individual has given consent to disclose the data. <br>
        A large number of students were able to identify the Act that the issue related to; a smaller number were then able to explain what the issue was relating to that Act. A small number identified the wrong act and were not able to gain any marks. Students who stated that there was no issue did not receive any marks. <br>
        The following is an example of a high-scoring response. <br>
        - 
        Yes, she should be worried. Privacy Act 1988 may be breached. This law outlines that data should not be used for anything other than its intended purpose. If sara was to send her client data, she would breach the Privacy Act 1988. </p>

        <p>I approve of the move, but it makes me wonder why section B persists. It achieves nothing that sections A or C could not do.</p>
