<p><b>Some comments by the examiners</b> </p>
<ul>
<li class="examiner">It was pleasing to see that when asked for two reasons or three features, etc., students gave the correct number of responses. </li>
<li class="examiner">It was clear that many students found it difficult to <em>explain</em>, <em>discuss</em> or <em>justify</em> their responses &ndash; those students who could were rewarded with better marks. This was particularly evident in Questions <a href="#11c">11c</a> and <a href="#12b">12b</a>. </li>
<li class="examiner">Students must be familiar with key words such as &lsquo;outline&rsquo;, &lsquo;explain&rsquo;, &lsquo;discuss&rsquo; and &lsquo;justify&rsquo; and understand that these words require longer responses than &lsquo;identify&rsquo; or &lsquo;list&rsquo;. </li>
<li class="examiner">Students continued to repeat the same point when asked to discuss or give multiple reasons relating to a scenario, eg Questions 2, 4b., 6, 10b. and 11c. For example, in Question 4b. students would explain the use of a hyperlink and then, when giving the second feature, would say they would have a link that went directly to another location. </li>
<li class="examiner">Students with lower marks found it difficult to select the appropriate knowledge required to respond to a particular scenario. For example, in Question <a href="#12d">12d</a>. some students did not realise that the size of the organisation and the large amount of data that would be stored on a regional server meant that a CD should not be the recommended backup medium.</li>
<li class="examiner"> Students who scored full marks in questions were able to clearly demonstrate that they not only understood the key knowledge but could also apply it appropriately to <em>specific scenarios</em>. </li>

<p class="comment">In Australia, one does NOT apply for copyright and have it granted (as one does for Trade Marks and patents). Copyright is *automatically* held by the creator of intellectual property (<a href="#evidence5">Evidence</a>).</p>

<p class="comment">Secondly, what on earth does the rest of it mean? I'm truly baffled.</p>
<p class="comment">Does Crazy Cartoons create cartoons and sell them to clients? If so, what's the stuff about copyright details on the invoice for? What 'copyright details'?? And what are the 'GST charges related to the copyright'???</p>
<p class="comment">OR does Crazy Cartoons earn its money by getting copyright for its clients' cartoons? (Which is impossible anyway)</p>
<p class="comment">Is this question completely insane or am I? Even if this is not bad enough, none of the answers is satisfactory.</p>
<p class="comment"> Putting GST on an invoice is mandatory, but listing copyright details (whatever that means) is optional... So when the question asks &quot;THIS IS AN EXAMPLE...&quot; which &quot;this&quot; are the examiners referring to - the GST, the copyright details?

<p>Dear Mr Kelly</p>
<p>I am responding to your message dated 15 November about Question 5 in 
the VCE examination in Information Processing and Management. 
Thank you for your detailed comments on this question, relating to the "application for copyright" and the ambiguity. </p>
<p>Following discussions 
between VCAA staff and the Chief Assessor, Question 5 has been re-scored. 
I am pleased to report that <strong>no student who attempted it will lose a 
mark</strong>. This will be reflected in students' results, the VCE Examination 
Results Service and in the Assessment Report. </p>
<p>I trust you find this outcome satisfactory. Thank you for your 
constructive feedback on the examination. </p>

B. employ one additional staff member.<br />

D. have all staff work an additional two hours each day next week.
</p><p class="myanswer">This is quite an odd one - hardly IPM at all. But it's interesting to work through it. </p>
<p class="myanswer">To start with, we need to work out how many hours or days they need to catch up - 5 working days for a team of 4 equals <strong>20 man-days </strong>they need to gain. Now let's look at the options... </p>
<p class="myanswer">&lt;A&gt; Getting all staff to work on Saturday would regain four working days (one day for each worker). It would take <strong>five </strong>Saturdays to recoup 20 working days.</p>
<p class="myanswer">&lt;B&gt; Employing <strong>one </strong>staff member would achieve an extra five working days per week. So it would take <strong>four weeks</strong> for the extra person to accumulate 20 working days at that rate.</p>
<p class="myanswer">&lt;C&gt; Employing 4 extra workers for <strong>one week</strong> would give 20 extra man-days... exactly what they need.</p>
<p class="myanswer">&lt;D&gt; Having all staff work 2 more hours a day for a week would gain 4 people * 2 hours * 5 days = 40 man-hours, which would equal 5 man-days (assuming a standard eight-hour day). Again, they'd need <strong>4 weeks</strong> of that to get the required time.</p>

</p><p class="myanswer"><em>I read the question as &quot;What features of password <strong>usage</strong> can help keep passwords secret?&quot; </em></p>
<p class="myanswer"><em>But I guess you can read it as &quot;What features of a password <strong>system</strong> improve security of the system?&quot; (e.g. encryption, aging of passwords, enforcing mandatory minimum password lengths, prevention of the reuse of old passwords etc)</em></p>
<p class="myanswer"><em>It's a shame the question is unclear. </em></p>
<p class="myanswer">State Average = 2.9 / 4 marks </p>
<p class="examiner">Some common responses were: &bull; do not write it down &bull; use both letters and numbers &bull; require passwords to be at least six characters in length &bull; require passwords to be changed regularly.</p>
<p>b. Select <strong>one</strong> feature from part <strong>a</strong>. and explain why this is necessary (1 mark - 4 lines)
</p><p> <span class="myanswer">These correspond to the points made above...
</span>
</p><ul class="myanswer">
<li>short passwords can be observed or guessed more easily than longer passwords.</li>
<li>if passwords are being used by unauthorised people, regular forced changes stop the people endlessly using the illicit access.</li>
<li>in passwords, uppercase letters are different to lowercase letters. Mixing them makes it much harder for someone to work out a password if they see it typed in.</li>
<li>using numerals will prevent passwords that are otherwise normal words being found by a &quot;dictionary&quot; attack where software tries logging in using every word in an electronic dictionary. </li>
<li>if someone knew and illictly used the old password, they would be able to re-gain access to the account if the old password was re-used.</li>
<li>people can read! </li>
<li>&quot;social engineering&quot; (e.g. phishing) is the easiest way to discover someone's password. The only people who should ask for a password are system administrators solving a problem for you. </li>
<li>a majority of people use passwords that an experienced hacker can guess in 3 attempts. First names, &quot;password&quot;, husbands/wives/pets, football teams are the top offenders.</li>
<li>anyone can determine a password if you let them watch you type it in. Even a letter or two here and there can give them enough of a clue to guess the rest. It is <em>not </em>rude to ask someone to turn away or stand aside when you enter a password. </li>
</ul><p class="myanswer"><em>Editorial : I'm not sure what the cartoon was meant to add to the question - it appears to be purely decoration. I really don't know why the examiners have been including irrelevant graphics into the IPM exams lately. </em>
</p><p class="myanswer">State Average = 1.4 / 2 marks 
</p><p class="examiner">The most common responses were: &bull; longer passwords are harder for hackers to guess as there are more combinations &bull; changing the password regularly means that if someone does guess the password they will not be able to access the account for very long before the password is changed.

Question 11</p><p>
Due to parental pressure, a primary school is considering the introduction of an online lunch-ordering system. Students will be able to log in each morning to place their orders using their classroom computers. Teachers will collect the money and confirm the orders each morning. The only new equipment needed will be in the canteen - a computer, printer and LAN cabling. The canteen manager will produce the following documents.
</p><ul>
<li> a print out of all orders for packing and delivery</li>
<li> receipts to be added to the lunch pack for students to take home each day</li>
</ul>
<p>A. Each classroom contains two networked computers that students use. Explain why this might be considered inadequate. (1 mark, 4 lines)
</p><p class="myanswer">There would be considerable competition for using the computers in the morning.

Advantages</h4>
<ul>
<li class="myanswer">Orders arrive electronically with no hard-to-read handwriting</li>
<li class="myanswer">Records can be kept of orders over time to assist with menu planning and ordering of food supplies. These records could also be used to deal with disputes over what was ordered.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Receipts are easy to produce</li>
</ul>
<h4>
Disadvantages</h4>
<ul>
<li class="myanswer">Having a computer and printer in the canteen will take up space.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Learning to use the computer and the network could be stressful.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Lunch orders would take quite some time to complete in the morning (because students would be competing for the limited number of computers), so the start of lunch making would be delayed. </li>
<li class="myanswer">The computer, printer and networking would cost money.</li>

</p><p>Question 12 
</p><p>
Eldorado had to replace an IT system that had been used for 20 years. Bob, the General Manager, says the replacement of their equipment (hardware and software) across 100 stores, each linked to their closest regional centre, was prompted by basic business needs. It was essential that daily operations were not disrupted.
</p><p>
The Victorian-based group wanted to boost sales by improving the product ranges available in their regional stores while reducing costs.
</p><p>A. The supplier has recommended a one-month parallel method of changing over to the new system rather than a direct conversion. Justify this recommendation covering <em>time</em> and <em>method</em>. (2 marks, 6 lines) 
</p><p class="myanswer"> Time: The month of parallel operation gives Eldorado time to learn and get used to the new system. It also gives time for bugs in hardware, software, documentation, training or procedures to be discovered and fixed before the new system fully takes over. 
</p><p class="myanswer">Method: Parallel operation is insurance in case the new system fails or does not perform properly. The old system is still in place and can take over immediately if the new system can no longer be used for any reason. It also allows the new system to be tested and evaluated against the current system by comparing speed, accuracy, quality of output etc. 
</p><p class="myanswer">State Average = 1.9 / 4
</p><p><a name="12b"></a>b. Two factors that need to be considered by Eldorado when implementing the changes to their IT system are
</p><ul>
<li> location of training</li>
<li> ergonomic requirements for users.</li>
</ul>
<p> For each of these factors recommend and justify an appropriate strategy for Eldorado's 100 stores. (4 marks) </p>

</p><ul>
<li> timing</li>
<li> storage location</li>
<li> media to be used. (6 marks, 5 lines each) </li>
</ul><p>
Timing 
</p><p class="myanswer">Incremental backups should be done daily (onto separate daily tapes) in the wee small hours so files are not open and locked (and therefore cannot be backed up), and the network is not slowed down by the backup.
</p><p class="myanswer"> Weekly full backups are done to 4 separate weekly tapes. Full backups are also done monthly and annually to separate tapes. Each daily tape is used once a week for a year and then promoted to become a weekly tape which is used once a month. As the tape ages, it is tested and promoted to become a monthly tape. Monthly tapes in turn are promoted to become annual tapes which are retired after having an annual backup stored on them. New tapes are bought to replace daily tapes as they are taken out of weekly service. </p><p>Storage location 
</p><p class="myanswer">Tapes are stored offsite in a fireproof safe. In this way, the system can be recovered if fire or other disaster strikes the file server. </p><p>
Media to be used
</p><p class="myanswer">Digital Audio Tape (DAT), also known as QIC (Quarter Inch Cassette) is the best medium. It offers very high capacity (e.g. 12,20, 40 gigabytes) which, when compressed, is adequate to hold a full server backup. It is very reliable, reasonably affordable (but not really cheap either), the tapes are compact and easy to store. Storage speed is not really an issue since the backups are automated and take place overnight when the system is idle.
