<p>First you had to name a software tool. It could be anything... some samples 
follow...</p>
<p>There are hundreds of possible answers. You could have mentioned software 
like:</p>
<p> <em>- webpage editor (Dreamweaver) - creates tables, frames, Javascript 
rollovers etc with no HTML coding. &quot;I created a template with standard 
formatting and contents and re-used this whenever I had to create a new 
page.&quot; </em></p>
<p><em> - word processor (MS Word) - generates tables of contents based on 
heading styles so you don't have to find all the section headings and 
their page numbers and copy/paste/type them.</em></p>
<p><em> - Gantt Chart producer (MS Project) - automatically finds the critical 
path in a project. Automatically adjusts existing tasks when new tasks 
are added.</em></p>
<p><em> - graphics program (Microsoft Image Composer) - can automatically 
apply drop shadows and texture effects onto images</em></p>
<p><em>- spreadsheet (MS Excel) - autofill will copy values into adjacent 
cells, and update the value automatically as it is copied (e.g. formulae, 
numbers, months)</em></p>
<p><em> - database (Access, Filemaker) - generate automatic forms and reports 
at the click of a button so you don't have to drag many fields onto a 
form or report manually. &quot;I used a default value of &quot;Yes&quot; 
for the field &quot;Is Alive?&quot; so the operator did not have to type 
it in all the time.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em> - text editor (Editpad) - allows search and replace over an unlimited 
number of documents so the same operation does not have to repeated many 
times. </em></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Also relevant would be the use of Wizards, macros, 
document embedding, formulas, autotext, autocomplete and queries. <br />
Spell/grammar checking were <em>not</em> acceptable answers.</font></b></p>

was? This overcomes the problems of there being many different &quot;flavours&quot; 
of the SDLC if you search around. At least you know what phase <em>the 
examiners</em> mean! </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b>a. Explain one strength and one weakness of 
this method of gathering data. </b></font></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Strength - </font></b><font color="#000000"><em>the 
staff know the organisation, and how the system might be used. It also 
gives them ownership and involvement in the process of change.</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b><em>- you can get more detail on users' comments 
so you can improve the system.</em></b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b><em>- the data is first-hand (primary) rather 
than interpreted by someone else</em></b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b><em>- personal interviews let you observe non-verbal 
communication (e.g. pulling faces)</em></b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b><em>- you can ask someone to clarify an answer 
or give more detail</em></b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b><em>- answers may be more reliable than those 
from a written survey</em></b></font></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Weakness - </font></b><font color="#000000"><font color="#000000"><em>the 
staff may well be ignorant of how such systems need to be built and expanded 
and may well be unaware of important capacities and features that the 
system might need now, or in the future.</em></font></font></p>
<p>(You don't ask a baby to design his own pram, do you? You might let him 
feel important by letting him suggest a colour, though!)</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b><em>- staff may be limited in their understanding 
of the system as a whole and may only be familiar with a part of it</em></b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b><em>- staff may think they are being judged, 
and give &quot;pleasing&quot; rather than honest answers</em></b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b><em>- the interviewer can bias the interview</em></b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b><em>- interviews are time-consuming and take 
people away from their work</em></b></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b><em>- respondents lack time to think through 
answers because they have to answer on the spot</em></b></font></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000">b. Several steps need to be completed before 
introducing the modified information system. Select the steps which occur 
in the analysis and design phases.</font></b></p>
<p><font color="#000000">You were then given 6 steps:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b><font color="#000000">Step 1: Train staff</font></b></font><font color="#000000"><b><br />
Step 2: Draw up the necessary input/output screens<br />
Step 3: Purchase new equipment<br />
Step 4: Document the procedures of the current system<br />
Step 5: Write user documentation<br />
Step 6: Survey users of the new system<br />
</b></font><br />
Then you had 2 lines of text to list the steps involved under &quot;Analysis&quot; 
and &quot;Design&quot; phases. This is where some 2002 examinees might 
be about to go, &quot;D'OH!&quot;.</p>
<p>You did not have to, and SHOULD NOT HAVE listed EVERY one of the 6 steps, 
if they did not fit into either analysis or design! Some steps were obviously 
not in either &quot;analysis&quot; or &quot;design&quot;!</p>
<p>This is not an easy question! I would guess (and these are open to argument!)...</p>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Analysis phase: </font></b><font color="#000000"><em> 
'Step 4' (or, you could have written 'document current procedures')</em></font></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Design phase: </font></b><font color="#000000"><em>'Step 
2' (or you could have written 'draw up I/O screens')</em></font></p>
<p>* Step 1 (training) is a late step (happens during implementation).<br />
* Step 3 (purchasing equipment) must come after design (during implementation)!<br />
* Step 5 (user documentation) cannot be carried out until the system design 
is finished and hardware/software is bought or built. However, you <b>can</b> 
and should specify what <b>forms</b> of documentation would be required 
for different users. Documentation could be written at the end of the 
development phase.<br />
* Step 6 is way out: obviously you can't survey users about a system that 
does not yet exist and that they have not used! It happens in the final 
evaluation/operation phase. </p>

<p><b><font color="#000000">Before creating a web site, Plans Plus, an architectural 
firm, has aksed you to develop a design of the site. What design technique 
would you use and why?</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Design technique: </font></b><font color="#000000"><em>Page 
mockups (pictures of what different screens should look like)</em></font></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Reason: </font></b><font color="#000000"><em>Since 
web pages are mainly visual information, page mockups would give the most 
accurate idea of what the finished site would look like.</em></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Since I had to choose only <b>one</b> technique, 
I felt it best to mention the <b>most useful</b> technique, if I could 
only choose <b>one</b>. I would, in real life, also use other techniques 
such as structure charts to show the site structure, flow charts/NS charts 
if I had to program Javascript etc </font></p>
<p>W<font color="#000000">hen I first saw the question, I thought, &quot;Easy. 
Page mockups.&quot; Then I thought, &quot;No - that's more a design <b>tool</b>, 
rather than a <b>technique</b>. Do they mean 'top down vs bottom up?'&quot; 
Like you in the exam room, I had to make a decision... </font></p>
<p> If students argued for &quot;top down&quot; design technique (as many 
did, according to email reports I received) - and justified it well - 
I would argue that they should at least get credit for their interpretation 
of a possibly fuzzy question. I checked the 2003 IT Study Design after 
the fact, and it does refer to &quot;Design Techniques as meaning things 
like mockups, but &quot;top-down&quot; could also be considered a 'design 
technique' in the broader sense.. </p>
<p><b>The moral of the story: if you believe a question is ambiguous, give 
alternative answers and justify them. Yes, it will take more time, but 
if you explain yourself, you can still get some or all of the allocated 
marks. </b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Also: Storyboard (to show how pages link together)<br />
Hierarchy chart, structure chart, site map: to show links and navigation 
paths.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000">UNACCEPTABLE answers: IPO charts, flow charts, 
data flow diagrams etc, because the question asks about the design of 
the site.</font></b></p>

<p>Remember, you only answer ONE of the options!</p>
<p><b><font color="#000000">If you chose Part A:</font></b></p>
<p><em>Test data is data that is deliberately created to fully test a solution 
with normal, abnormal and faulty data. Test data is deliberately difficult 
for a solution to process: it often includes &quot;boundary condition&quot; 
data that tests whether the solution is behaving properly with values 
that are on the border between one state and another. e.g. if you created 
a spreadsheet formula to determine whether a person's birthdate made them 
18 years old, you would want to include test data that included &quot;boundary 
condition&quot; data such as &quot;one day short of 18&quot;, &quot;18 
exactly&quot; and &quot;one day past 18&quot; and test if the solution 
handled the &quot;tricky situations&quot; accurately or not.</em></p>
<p><em>The other reason to use test data rather than real data is to avoid 
the chance of destroying the real and valuable data with a solution that 
is not yet working properly. </em></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000">If you chose Part B:</font></b></p>
<p><em><font color="#000000">The main point of testing written documents 
is that their message is conveyed accurately and efficiently to the intended 
type of reader. If the information is not conveyed properly (e.g. it is 
misleading, ambiguous or confusing), the entire purpose of the document 
has failed.</font></em></p>
<p><em><font color="#000000">The message can be tested by giving it to people, 
who are typical of the intended audience, to read, and then questioning 
them about their understanding of the meaning of the document. If they 
give incomplete, wrong or confused answers (e.g. prior interviews established 
he was unmarried, but he said on a form that he was &quot;separated&quot;), 
it may indicate the document needs extra work to make its information 
or questions clearer. Further testing subjects may include those &quot;difficult 
cases&quot; with poor language skills. If they understand the document 
well, its message is probably clearly written.</font></em></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Saying that testing can be achieved by proofreading 
is not enough.</font></b></p>

<p>For some reason, task 1 is missing on the exam, and this is where the 
answer becomes difficult.</p>
<p><b>Logically</b>, one would notify staff of the room's closure <b>before</b> 
you empty the room of furniture, so task 1 would be a predecessor of task 
2. The critical path would therefore be tasks 1,2,5,7,8. Add up their

<p><em>The critical path takes 6 days.</em></p>
<p><b>Technically</b>, the answer must be 6 days because the table says 
task 2 has no predecessors. In reality, however, such situations only 
occur in Dilbert comic strips.</p>
<p>You would be safest to explain your answer, but if the examiners don't

not lose or get &quot;conned&quot; into revealing a password. Also, passwords 
can be guessed. Less effort is needed of users: they only have to put 
a finger on a pad or put an eye to an eyepiece. It involves no typing, 
so access would probably be faster.</em></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b>Advantage 2</b></font></p>
<p><em>Biometric identification actually identifies that people are who they

they forget to bring their finger or eye!</em></p>

<p>(BTW - if you said retinal scanning was a disadvantage because villains 
could cut out your eye and show it to the scanner - bad luck! The real

<p>The other options were:</p>
<p><b><font color="#000000">- record the number of customer complaints</font></b> 
[complaints about what? reliability? speed? sticky seats?] <br />
<font color="#000000"><b>- record equipment breakdowns per day</b></font> 
[measures reliability, not speed]<br />
<font color="#000000"><b>- complete a staff satisfaction form</b></font> 
[staff opinions are not a reliable empirical measure]<br />
<font color="#000000"><b>- record server start-up times per day</b></font> 
[see discussion that follows]<br />
<br />
Some students have queried my answer. Here's how I see it. <b>Assuming</b> 
the system is working to capacity, the number of sales per day would be 
greater if the system were faster. Obviously, if no-one books a ticket 
all day, the system speed would be zero. <b>None</b> of the options is 
a good empirical measure of speed.</p>
<p>Option 4, &quot;record server start-up times per day&quot; is ambiguous, 
I reckon. The other &quot;per day&quot; options mean a count for each 
day of breakdowns or sales. So option 4 should mean &quot;How many times 
did the server start up each day&quot; (indicating it had crashed?)</p>
<p> I found the wording ambiguous and inconsistent with the other options. 
The other obvious point is that LAN servers are rarely turned off each 
night, thereby requiring a daily startup!</p>
<p>Even if option 4 meant &quot;record how long the server took to start 
up each day&quot;, startup times would not be a good indicator of the 
speed of the TPS system. My old TRS-80 started up in 1 second in 1978, 
but I doubt that would be a reliable indicator of how fast it ran software.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to say sales per day is a <b>good</b> measure of system 
speed, because it's not. It's just better than the other bad options,

<p>Take your pick...</p>
<p><em>- the course may be irrelevant and boring to experienced computer

- it does not seem to discuss the use of the new system, just how to use 
computers<br />
- it's at night, meaning staff either have to give up personal time or 
get paid overtime<br />
- it's not at their workplace, which might be inconvenient to some people<br />
- all staff, regardless of their roles, have the same training.<br />
- lectures may produce poor results for people who learn best from active 
involvement or demonstrations<br />
- two hours? You'd be lucky to have a single conscious employee at the 
end of it<br />
- they never get to actually use the system themselves</em></p>
<p><em><b><font color="#000000">- staff are not training on their own computers<br />
- the trainer may not be good at teaching<br />
</font> </b> </em> </p>
<p><b><font color="#000000">e. Recommend a more suitable training strategy. 
Justify your choice.</font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Strategy - </font></b></p>
<p><em>Each user would get training according to their role in using the 
system. If there were few people involved, personal one-on-one or small 
group practical training would be most effective. If there were many people 
to be trained on the same simple topic, they could use trainer-trainee 
where a small group of competent people would be trained and they in turn 
trained their colleagues. All training would be best carried out in their 
real workplace.</em></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Justification - </font></b></p>
<p><em>Lectures typically result in 5% information retention after a week. 
Practical exercises with the real system in their real workplace would 
be much more comfortable, relevant and interesting, and users who had 
trouble would receive personalised attention from the tutor. By training 
each person in the skills they require to carry out their role (e.g. phone 
assistant, manager), they are not subjected to irrelevant and confusing 
information and can concentrate on what matters to them. By separating 
ignorant and experienced computer users, you can target your instruction 
to each group and build the skills of the ignorant workers, but not bore 
the experts. </em> </p>
<p>Consider these factors: What is taught? When does training happen? What 
other support is given (e.g. phone/email/in-house)? What skill level should 
the training start with? What form will training take? (train the trainer, 
in-house, external, group, online?)</p>

<p><b><font color="#000000">A small accounting firm specialises in completing 
taxation returns for small businesses. The files are therefore confidential 
and critical to meeting the demands of the GST. Once a month the office 
manager creates a tape backup of the network drive. The tape is stored 
on the owner's desk. The firm has decided to develop a disaster recovery 
plan. Explain three potential threats that will need to be addressed. 
Recommend an appropriate strategy for each threat identified.</font></b></p>
<p>My suggestions are in point form because it's late and I'm tired: you 
would need to explain them in more detail. </p>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><em>Two threats can have the same strategy to 
halt them.<br />
Do not allow repetition of threats. (e.g. fire, flood, storm are all &quot;natural 
disasters&quot;)<br />
Three different threats need to be explained. </em></font></b></p>
<p><em><b>Threat</b> - backup is not frequent enough<br />
<b>Strategy</b> - backup daily - weekly full backups and incremental daily 
backups </em></p>
<p><em><b>Threat</b> - the tape is stored on the owner's desk<br />
<b>Strategy</b> - the tape should taken to a secure place off-site each 
night (e.g. a fireproof safe in the owner's home)</em></p>
<p><em><b>Threat</b> - the data can be read if the backup tape is stolen<br />
<b>Strategy</b> - the backup data can be encrypted</em></p>
<p><b><em>Threat</em></b><em> - staff could access unauthorised data on the 
server<br />
<b>Strategy</b> - use password protection to limit staff to data they 
require for their work, and use network audit trails to record who requests 
what data</em></p>
<p><em><b>Threat</b> - there is no organised, long-term backup plan<br />
<b>Strategy</b> - use a backup scheme such as Grandfather-Father-Son to 
ensure data can be recovered from any distant point in time.</em></p>
<p><em><b>Threat </b>- fire damage to equipment and data<br />
<b>Strategy</b> - fire-fighting equipment onsite</em></p>
<p><b><em>Threat</em></b><em> - sensitive data could be stored on vulnerable 
workstations<br />
<b>Strategy</b> - all data should be saved to the file server which should 
be stored in a physically secure room, and protected by air-conditioning, 
uninterruptible power supply, floppy disk drive lock, RAID, bars, security 
cameras, guards, dogs, falling elephant traps... </em></p>
<p><em>Sorry. I'm more tired than I thought.</em></p>
