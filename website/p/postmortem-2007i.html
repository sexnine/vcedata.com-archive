<p>A new layout for a timetable must be produced from an existing spreadsheet and multiple copies printed on a company's black and white laser printer, rather than the new colour printer. 
The constraints on this solution are best described as</p>
<p>A. economic and operational.<br />
B. operational and social.<br />
C. social and technical.<br />
D. technical and economic.*</p>
<p class="comment">Hmmm. The IT glossary does define constraints as including economic, social and technical, so that rules out options A and B. The use of that specific printer is a technical constraint, but that does not help further limit the possibilities. So we need to decide between <em>social</em> and <em>economic</em>. There's no hint of a &quot;people&quot; issue so it must be economic. One supposes that the company insisted on using the B&amp;W printer because it was cheaper, but it's a bit of a stretch for students to have to <em>assume</em> that - some colour printers cost the same amount as B&amp;W lasers if the page is monochrome, so the colour laser might <em>not </em>be cheaper. </p>

<br />
B and C are silly. <br />
<br />
So are we to accept that validation is used to check the accuracy of calculations?&nbsp; Not really - that's called testing. <br />

I think the question is just plain wrong, and I'm tempted to appeal against it on the grounds of factual inaccuracy. <br />

B. an organisational goal at the strategic level of decision making.<br />
C. an organisational objective at the tactical level of decision making.*<br />

<p>Question 20</p>
<p> A school library keeps track of book loans using a relational database which has tables called Books, Borrowers, and Loans. Parts of these tables are shown below.</p>
<p><img src= "/m/pm/07i-a20a.jpg" width="438" height="396" /> </p>
<p>Which diagram best represents the relationship between these tables?</p>
<p><img src= "/m/pm/07i-a20b.jpg" width="579" height="550" /> </p>
<p><span class="myanswer">Answer (I hope!) is B.*</span></p>
<p class="myanswer">Firstly, fortunately, Filemaker and Access show relationships in similar charts, so this was not a problem for either of them. Such representations are also pretty standard in the database world, so most DBMS users could make sense of it. </p>
<p class="myanswer">This was quite a challenging question: certainly a discriminator to find the A+ students in the audience. The 4 options are identical except for the &quot;1 to many&quot; or &quot;many to 1&quot; relationship indicators. It took me quite a few minutes to get my head around it. </p>
<p class="myanswer">This is how I read it...</p>
<ul>
<li class="myanswer">A book can be lent out to many people over time, so the Loans table could refer to the same book many times. </li>
<li class="myanswer">A borrower can borrow many books over time, so again the Loans table would refer to the same borrower many times.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Therefore the Loans table has many references to individual books and borrowers - each of the many loans is strictly tied to a <em>single</em> book and a <em>single </em>borrower.</li>
<li class="myanswer">So one book can be linked to many Loans.</li>
<li class="myanswer">One borrower can be linked to many Loans. </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="red">34% of the state got this right.</span></p>
<p class="examiner">The fairly even distribution across the incorrect options suggested that many students did not understand either the one-to-many relationship or its representation in the diagram. The correct response was option B, as it was the only diagram where the Book_ID was shown as one (unique) in the Book table and the Borrower_ID was shown as one (unique) in the Borrower table. </p>

<p> a. Indicate in which position (A-H) you would place the Weekly Newsletter link. Justify your choice (1+2 lines, 2 marks).<span class="red"> State average=1.7</span></p>
<p class="myanswer">You'd have to go for D. It's logical to look for a newsletter immediately under a &quot;News&quot; heading. C is bad because it's nested in an illogical subpage. E to G make no sense. H is a reasonably logical place for parents to look too. A - a link on the home page - is a possibility if they consider their newsletter <em>really</em> important.

The local council has a large library of movies, video clips and articles. Library members access video clips and articles via the council website. New articles and video clips are added to the library every day. 
The technician has chosen a portable (external) hard disk as a backup media.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Arghh! &quot;a backup medium&quot;. Singular! Not plural! </p>

<p class="myanswer">Other advantages could be:</p>
<ul>
<li class="myanswer"> low cost per megabyte stored</li>

<p>The mobile phone company would like to add a graph (chart) to this account.</p>
<p>c. Recommend a graph and explain how it would improve communication of the information. 2 marks<span class="red"> State average=0.9</span></p>
<p>Graph</p>
<p class="myanswer">A bar chart showing a total talk time and/or cost for each carrier would be handy. </p>
<p>Explanation</p>
<p class="myanswer">It would show the customer how much time and money was spent on each carrier. The customer could more easily choose which carrier to use for future calls. </p>
<p class="examiner" 
>A pie or bar chart of the &lsquo;Duration of Call&rsquo; or &lsquo;Cost of Call&rsquo; data would quickly show a comparison of call duration or percentage cost per carrier. A number of other chart types and appropriate explanations were also considered worthy of full marks. </p>
<p>You have been asked to group the calls from each carrier as shown below.</p>

</ul>
<p><span class="comment">Am I missing something here, or is the question just very poorly worded?</span> </p>
<p class="examiner">Select cells A7 to D18 and use the sort function in ascending order. It was disappointing to note that so few students were able to answer this question correctly. </p>
<p class="comment" 
>Hmm - it was disappointing that the exam question was so poorly written! </p>
<p>Managers have suggested the formula =If(B2&gt;(B3+ l00),&quot;ALERT&quot;,&quot; &quot;) be placed in cell C5 to alert customers when their new bill is $100 or more than their previous bill.</p>
<p class="myanswer"><em>As Matthew, a student, pointed out - the formula is wrong. It tests for values $100 over the last bill, but not $100 or more. It should have been &gt;= and not &gt;. </em></p>
<p>e. Recommend appropriate data to test the formula for C5 and show expected results. 4 marks <span class="red"> State average=2.0</span></p>
<p class="myanswer">You could either enter data in C7 to C18 that added up to a certain value or you could temporarily overwrite the formulas in B2 &amp; B3 for testing the new formula in C5. Take your pick, but let's assume that B2 and B3 contain the following values whichever way you do it.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Note: the data suggested below tests for the &quot;$200 or more&quot; condition rather than the &quot;more than $200&quot; the examiners mistakenly used in their suggested formula. Remember, kiddies: it's usually boundary conditions that break your logical tests!</p>

<td><p>Question 12<br />
A map-making and surveying company wants to improve electronic communications between the crews working in the city, the country and head office. The laptops combined with smart phones will allow crews to upload maps and photographs onto the company website for staff comment.</p>
<p><img src= "/m/pm/07i-b12.jpg" width="695" height="577" /></p>
<p>a. Select one laptop feature and one smart phone feature and describe how each will help input or process useful data for crews working in the country. 2 marks.<span class="red"> State average=0.9</span></p>
<p>Laptop Feature</p>
<p class="myanswer">The touchpad</p>
<p>Description</p>
<p class="myanswer"> It is a convenient replacement for a mouse when using a mouse is awkward. (Don't refer to the modem being a data input device - it's properly classified as a communications device.) </p>
<p class="myanswer">You could also argue that the 1.7GHz CPU is reasonably powerful for processing lots of topological data. </p>
<p>Smart phone Feature</p>
<p class="myanswer">The full keyboard </p>
<p>Description</p>
<p class="myanswer">Aids data entry - no more pressing each button 3 times to enter a single letter!</p>
<p class="myanswer">You could also say the camera is good for data input of pictures, or the Windows Mobile 5.0 operating system and MS Office lets them run many standard Windows programs on the portable device. </p>
<p class="examiner" 
>Laptop feature: Photoshop will help crews to process (recolour, crop or resize) images of the land they are mapping. <br />
Smart phone feature: A full keyboard or camera will help crews input data quickly while moving around the country. </p>
<p class="examiner"> Many students selected features that were not associated with the input or processing of data or they did not relate their response to crews working in the country. </p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp; Identify one hardware component required for the laptops to provide communication between crews in 
the country and head office. Explain the function of the component. 2 marks <span class="red"> State average=1.05</span></p>
<p>Hardware</p>
<p class="myanswer">Modem </p>
<p>Explanation</p>
<p class="myanswer">It converts digital data into analogue data for communication over phone lines (either dialup or ADSL - same principle, different frequencies of sound). It lets them exchange email, for example, or access web wikis or chat rooms. </p>
<p><span class="red">Modem: A modem will allow crews to use the analogue phone network to send digital images to head office. </span></p>
<p>c. Identify two features of the smart phone that will assist video conferencing between crews and head 
office. 2 marks <span class="red"> State average=1.8</span></p>
<p>Feature 1</p>
<p class="myanswer">Internet Explorer Mobile (web browser) </p>
<p> Feature 2</p>
<p class="myanswer">Still/Video Camera (for video of the talking heads)</p>
<p class="myanswer">Note - don't discuss 'em , just identify 'em! </p>
<p class="examiner" 
>Acceptable answers included: <br />
&bull; camera pictures and video <br />
&bull; Internet access <br />
&bull; wireless broadband <br />
&bull; Windows Mobile 5.0 <br />
&bull; Internet Explorer Mobile. <br />
Constant advances in mobile technology meant that other features on the list could be accepted as likely to assist video conferencing. </p>
<p> d. Recommend one security feature the smart phones need to protect map-making and survey data when 
being communicated to head office. Justify your choice. 2 marks. <span class="red"> State average=1.0</span></p>
<p>Recommendation</p>
<p class="myanswer">Encryption</p>
<p>Justification</p>
<p class="myanswer">Even if the data were intercepted, they would be useless to the interceptors since encryption renders the data unreadable by unauthorised people. </p>
<p class="examiner" 
>Encryption: Encrypted data is &lsquo;scrambled&rsquo; so that even if it is intercepted it is unreadable to hackers. Only the person at head office with the correct encryption key can &lsquo;unscramble&rsquo; the data and read it. </p>
<p class="examiner" 
>It was pleasing to note that many students were able to explain how various laptop and smart phone features helped input data or process information and to describe how a modem would support communication between crews working in the country and head office. The majority of students also explained very clearly how encryption works. A smaller number also described the procedures associated with the key that needs to accompany it. </p>
