<p> A. design phase<br />
B. analysis phase<br />

<p class="myanswer">Answer is D. Documentation occurs during implementation (unless you're using an SDLC with a separate documentation phase.) Documentation can't be written until the product is finished (so rule out options A and B) and evaluation occurs way <em>after</em> implementation.</p>

B. phased.<br />
C. direct.<br />
D. pilot.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Answer is B. It sounded a bit like 'pilot' when it said 'three stores initially' but those stores were not used to test the system and learn lessons from so the full rollout would be more successful. Bringing change in in stages is phased implementation.</p>

<p> A. backing up of files.<br />
B. archiving of files.<br />
C. disposal of files.<br />
D. encryption of files.</p>

<p align="left"><img src="/m/pm/09s-a12-16.jpg" width="440" height="338" /></p>

D. the different fonts used in the field headings</p>
<p class="myanswer">Answer is C. Obviously. There's nothing particularly hideous about the button placement; B&amp;W would not add nor detract much from usability; the font changes may be irritating but are otherwise trivial. The sorting of users by membership number makes sense to a database, but is useless as far as a human is concerned.</p>

<td><p><strong>Question 13</strong></p>
<p>When the 'save' button is clicked the program can take up to one minute to save all the data. The trial users reported that they did not know how long they might have to wait or when they could start editing again.<br />
The best way for the developer to deal with this is to</p>
<p> A. program in a 'meter' which displays how much is left to save and disappears when the save is complete.<br />
B. program a message to be displayed which says 'please wait'.<br />
C. program a message to be displayed after the save is complete which says 'records saved'.<br />
D. do nothing because a minute is not such a long time.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Answer is A. Animated progress meters are important for humans who tend to get nervous when computers seem to have possibly frozen: they tend to anxiously push all sorts of buttons as their panic increases. A reassuring message indicating an ETA at least tells them that things are well. It is better than a static &quot;please wait&quot; which could indeed cover up a software freeze. Telling the person after the event does nothing to help them during the event! D may make sense to the programmer who knows what is 'normal' waiting time, but it does not help a casual user.

C. A gender has been entered as 'N'.<br />
D. A first name has been entered all in capitals.</p>

Validation can also check for text case (upper,lower,title etc) but again it's not serious.

<p align="left"> When the LAN was first installed its goal was to improve the overall efficiency of the transfer of information within the business.<br />
To achieve this goal there were a number of system objectives, one of which could have been</p>
<p> A. to eliminate the need to copy data to and from CD.<br />
B. to improve the clarity of information presented on screen and paper.<br />
C. to minimise errors in data when it was transferred from one computer to another.<br />
D. to maximise the amount of time workers could spend speaking to one another about work issues.
</p>
<p class="myanswer">Answer is A. Has to be, because the other options can be ruled out. Keep in mind the key words of the question's stem. They want to improve the <strong>efficiency</strong> of <strong>information transfer</strong>.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Can't be B - Improving clarity of info is not an efficiency measure: it's <strong>effectiveness</strong> (quality of the product, how well it achieves its goals)<br />
Can't be C - while it is about data transfer, accuracy is again an <strong>effectiveness</strong> measure, not efficiency.<br />
Can't be D. While time saving is an efficiency measure, chatting about work is not a <strong>data transfer</strong> issue. </p>

<p><strong>Question 18</strong> <em>(2011-2014 - It's doubtful whether detailed questions on topologies are still relevant)</em></p>
<p>ASM's local area network is now outdated and it no longer meets its system goal. It has been suggested that a new network be installed as shown in the following diagram.</p>
<p><img src="/m/pm/09s-a18.jpg" width="480" height="294" /></p>
<p>Based on the two network diagrams, the topology of the network is most likely being changed from</p>
<p> A. a star network to a bus network.<br />
B. a star network to a hybrid network.<br />
C. a bus network to a hybrid network.<br />
D. a bus network to a star network.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Answer is D. The original LAN had cables from the workstation all connecting (via T-pieces) to a single (coaxial) cable that led to the server. That's 'bus' and is now superseded. The new LAN has individual (CAT5e or CAT6) UTP cables from workstations going to a switch which has a single cable leading to the server. That's star topology, and it the norm for SOHO (Small Office / Home Office) LANs.</p>

<p><strong>Question 3</strong></p>
<p>A school has decided to purchase a new electronic roll-marking software package. The software allows teachers to mark a student absent by scanning a barcode printed next to the absent student's name in the rollbook. This is done by using either a portable computing device that has a built-in barcode reader or by using a barcode reader that can be attached to an existing portable device. The information is then transmitted wirelessly to a central computer which alerts the coordinators of students absent from class. As the school supplied its staff with portable computing devices just last year, the principal wants to purchase only barcode readers which staff can use on their existing devices. Before purchasing the new system the school needs to check the specifications of the existing devices.</p>
<p>From the list below select the <strong>three</strong> features that the existing portable computing devices <strong>must have</strong> for the roll-marking system to work and justify your selection.</p>
<p>A&nbsp; large 8.2&quot; screen<br />

<p>Juan, a novice programmer, is writing the program. He has chosen a programming language that recognises the following data types: integer, floating-point decimal, text and Boolean. It will also allow the creation of data structures such as arrays and records.<br />
Juan will use a variable named ItemCost to hold the cost of an item. He has decided to make ItemCost an integer.</p>

<p class="comment">Hmmm. <strong>Another</strong> data type question? We just had that in question B1 above.</p>
<p>Juan knows that for the program to run most efficiently it should read all the relevant data into memory first.

[7 lines provided]</p>

<p>2 marks - state average 0.8</p>
<p class="examiner">Students should be able to describe data structures, the advantages of their use and their weaknesses. Many students did not provide a response to the question, which is disappointing as data structures feature in both Units 3 and 4. The following are examples of acceptable student responses.</p>
<p class="examiner">- <em>An array only has to be defined once and can hold a large amount of items in its list. The array can be easily loaded up at the start of the application, more quickly then loading up large amounts of variables, therefore saving on time thus being more efficient.<br />
- Writing a large number of variables is very time consuming and makes the program look too messy (for other coders). By placing the variable ItemCost in an array, he does not need to create a large number of variables because the array is made up of the variables. An array holds one data element so an array could contain ItemCost, this way it is more efficient to run (the program needs only to search the array) and it is less time consuming.</em></p>

<p><strong>Question 5</strong></p>
<p>A programmer wishes to check that when a new product number is entered, it is valid and within the prescribed limits. If it is invalid then the user needs to know why. The programmer has chosen to validate the data in the following order: Existence test, Numeric test, Range test.</p>
<p align="left">Explain why this order is necessary.</p>
<p align="left" class="myanswer">The validation tests are dependent on preceding tests. Later tests are pointless if a preceding test has already failed. If the data does not exist, no following test makes sense; if it's not numeric, a range test is pointless.</p>
<p>3 marks - state average 1.8</p>
<p class="examiner">In general, students made a reasonable attempt at responding to this question. It was clear they knew the reason for the validation order; however, many had difficulty explaining why the order was necessary without simply restating the question. Students need to practise questions that require them to articulate programming concepts, not simply utilise these concepts while programming.</p>
<p class="examiner">The following is an example of a good student response.<br />
<em>This order systematically validates the data and whether it is in the prescribed limits. A numeric test cannot be undertaken if the item does not exist. The existence test assures the user that the product is there. If that succeeds then proceed to the numeric test. If not, the problem is narrowed to just the existence. Finally, if the numeric test succeeds, then the range test can be conducted to ensure that out of parameter numbers will not occur.</em></p>

<p>Figure 1</p>
<p align="left">The business is almost 30 years old and has factories in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Perth.<br />
In 2001 Truss-Tee converted all four factories from manual manufacture to computer-assisted manufacture of<br />
trusses and frames. In each factory identical systems were set up and these are still in operation today.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Current system - hardware and software</strong></p>

<p align="left">RoboCut is a computer-controlled timber cutting system.<br />
The main software component in each factory system is a package called 'MyCut 2020'. Truss-Tee pays an annual licence fee of $8800 to MyCut and this entitles it to receive all package upgrades. The package has two parts.</p>
<ol>
<li>MyCut DESIGNER - installed on PC2 and PC3</li>
<li>MyCut DATABASE - only installed on PC 1 PCI also has office-style software installed.</li>
</ol> 
<p align="left"><strong>Current system - people and their roles</strong></p>
<p align="left"> Each factory has a manager, two designers and eight assemblers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The manager</strong> uses PCI to carry out management tasks, including answering letters and emails, and dealing with the factory's financial matters. The manager also works with clients. This includes starting a new job by entering the client's details into the MyCut DATABASE and later preparing a quote. The quote cannot be prepared until the designers have created the cost data. When they have, the manager obtains the transport cost from Move It, a trucking company, and combines it with the cost data stored in MyCut DATABASE to produce the quote. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>The designers</strong> use PC2 and PC3. They enter detailed house plans for each job using MyCut DESIGNER. This is done by drawing the plans on the screen and typing in the dimensions. It is an exacting task requiring a sound knowledge of building practice, so the designers must be qualified carpenters. Depending on the size of the plans it can take three to eight hours to properly enter plans for one house. </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Once the house plans are entered MyCut DESIGNER works out the best design of the trusses and frames and creates the engineering data and cost data needed for the job.<br />
When a job is ready for the manufacturing stage, one of the designers uses MyCut DESIGNER to produce cutting data and sends this to the RoboCut machine. This takes about five minutes.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<div align="left"><strong>The assemblers</strong> put the trusses and frames together after RoboCut has cut all the timber required for a job. Once assembly is complete the trusses and frames are transported to the building site.</div>

<strong><br />
The problem</strong></p>
<p> Last year two designers resigned from Truss-Tee, one from the Sydney factory and one from Melbourne. With an Australia-wide skill shortage, Truss-Tee has not been able to find two qualified carpenters who can do the designer jobs. It has tried to retrain some of the assemblers, but this has not proved successful.</p>
<p>Later this year the other designer in Melbourne is due to retire. Truss-Tee is very concerned about how it can continue to provide high quality service if it cannot obtain skilled carpenters.</p>
<p>Shaun Truscott is the managing director of Truss-Tee. He is aware that each factory has times when its designers have little to do. If their workload could be shared across the four factories, Truss-Tee would not need so many designers.</p>

Students were provided with a data flow diagram to assist in interpreting the data flows and processing described in the case study. Many found interpreting the data flow diagram quite difficult. Some students gave only one process or listed all processes and received no marks. The question asked for the names of the processes; this clearly indicated that more than one process was required for a complete response.</p>
<p> b. State which of the PCs are used to perform the 'Validate client data' and 'Create new job' processes.</p>

<p><br />
c. Explain the purpose of the 'Validate client data' process.</p>
<p class="myanswer">It would make sure all the required client data was present and reasonable (e.g. name exists, postcode is 4 digits) in order to get in touch with them again.</p>
<p>1 mark - average 0.3</p>
<p class="examiner">A possible response could have been checking the data entry to ensure only reasonable data is allowed into the system. It was clear from students' responses that they had a general understanding of validation and why it is used, with many answering 'to check data' or 'to validate data'. However, very few students could articulate a clear definition of the process 'validate client data'. The study design defines validate as 'to check that data input to a computer system is of an appropriate type for processing and within acceptable boundaries' (page 52). Although this is the definition all students should study, responses clearly indicated that very few students had actively studied the glossary. Teachers are encouraged to copy the glossary for all students and test their understanding and knowledge of written definitions throughout the year.</p>

<p align="left">Rose has found that the My Cut software is designed only to work on local area networks. To allow work to be shared between factories she proposes that a large format scanner be placed in each factory. The purpose of the scanner will be to scan house plans. Rose also proposes the following procedure, using the Melbourne factory as an example.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Step 1:</strong> When the Melbourne factory receives a set of plans for a house it will scan them and save each sheet as a separate Graphic Interchange Format (GIF) file. On average each set of plans has four separate sheets.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Step 2:</strong> If the factory in Melbourne cannot do the design work, but the factory in Perth can, then the Melbourne factory will send the GIF files to Perth via the Internet.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Step 3:</strong> When the Perth factory has entered the plans into its MyCut DESIGNER, it will export the engineering data and cost data to a text file. The text file will be sent to the Melbourne factory.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Step 4:</strong> The Melbourne factory will import the text file into its MyCut DATABASE. It will then produce the cutting data and proceed as usual.</p>
<p align="left">Rose wants the scanner connected to PC1. She expects each GIF file to be at least 40 Mb in size. She also expects that each factory will scan about 250 sets of plans in a year. Adding the scanner will mean that other changes will have to be made to the system.</p>

<p><strong>Question 4</strong></p>
<p>Perform a suitable calculation and use your result to explain why the existing Internet connection in each factory will no longer be appropriate.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Calculation</strong></p>
<p class="myanswer">Each set of plans averages 4 x 40M = 160M per set. V90 analogue modems can <strong>download</strong> at a theoretical maximum speed of 56Kbps, but (and here's the big but) they can <strong>upload</strong> at a maximum speed of 33.6 Kbps!</p>
<p class="myanswer">At 33.6 Kbps to upload 160MB, the dialup modem would take...</p>
<p class="myanswer">160,000,000 bytes * 8 bits = 1,280,000,000 bits / 33600 bps = 38,095 seconds = 635 minutes = 10.5 hours per set of plans!</p>
<p class="comment">Most students probably said it would take about 8 hours, assuming upload speeds were 56Kbps (and that 56K was actually attainable in real life - which is hardly ever <strong>is</strong>. Never mind - the principle is still right.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
<p class="myanswer">It would take an entire extra-long working day to transmit the files for a single set of plans!
</p>
<p>3 marks - average 1.2</p>
<p class="comment">How many people remembered the asymmetric speeds of V90? I bet no kids knew it...</p>
<p class="examiner">Possible calculations included:<br />
&bull; ((40,000,000 bytes * 8)/56,000 bits)/60 = 95.23 min<br />
&bull; (40,000,000 bits/56,000 bits)/60 = 11.9 min<br />
&bull; ((40,000,000 bytes * 10)/56,000 bits)/60 = 119 min (takes into account check bits and check sums that would<br />
be added).</p>
<p class="examiner">Students could also multiply any of the above by four, as on average each set of plans involved four pages.<br />
Results using either 40 Mb or 40 MB were accepted.<br />
The second part of the question asked students to explain in detail why the existing Internet connection would no longer<br />
be appropriate.<br />
Following is an example of an acceptable response.<br />
<em>One GIF file sent at a speed of 56kpps will take 95 minutes to send. The Truss-Tee company cannot afford to spend time waiting for files to transfer back and forth. This could lose the company clients and also waste worker time as they cannot work until a file is received. Paying the workers to wait is costing the company money.</em></p>

<span class="red">This question asked students to suggest a backup medium and justify their answer. However, many students read this as 'provide a backup strategy'. The question did not ask about when and how the backup would happen, nor its storage location. Stating a backup medium with sufficient capacity and justifying it based on the large capacity required by Truss-Tees was expected.<br />
Following is an example of an acceptable student response.<br />
<em>A suitable backup medium for PC1 is an external hard drive. As the amount of data on PC1 could be quite large, storage<br />
mediums such as CDs and DVDs will be ineffective as Truss-Tees will need a large number of them. An external hard drive will 
be suitable as they can be purchased in a large size (eg150GB) and will be able to store all the backup files from PC1 each day.

<p>2 + 2 + 2 = 6 marks. State average was 3.4</p>
<p class="comment">RAM and CPU could easily be swapped. They are about equal in terms of importance. I didn't choose Connectivity because even an average NIC (100Mbps) is far faster than the fastest typical current internet speed (23Mbps). The screen size and number of USB ports is not really important to the case study. The designers would probably care for bigger screens, but not PC1.</p>
<p class="examiner">Possible answers included:<br />
&bull; CPU &ndash; PC1 needs a fast CPU as it may be processing many tasks at once, including scanning plans, entering client details into the database and other various management tasks for Truss-Tee<br />
&bull; storage &ndash; PC1 will need a good amount of storage on which to store the GIF plans, plus any additional files. Since each GIF is 40 Mb large, a large hard drive is needed<br />
&bull; RAM &ndash; PC1 needs to have sufficient RAM to be able to store temporary parts of the images scanned to hard drive from the scanner.</p>
<p class="examiner">The question was answered with varying degrees of success. Students were asked to list the three most important<br />
specifications that should be considered by Truss-Tee when selecting a new PC1; however, it appeared that a number of<br />
students failed to read these key words. It appeared that some students randomly picked three specifications and<br />
described them, and others thought they needed to select from computer ABC, GP or Bell. Some students assumed they<br />
needed to pick the PC with the best RAM, storage or screen and explain why it was better. All three of these<br />
interpretations were incorrect. This is an example of where giving students many past examinations questions and/or<br />
papers can help them with the experience of attempting to respond to questions under examination conditions. In this<br />
case, the table provided stimulus rather than options to be selected from.</p>

<p><strong>Question 7</strong></p>
<p>During her analysis of the system, Rose interviewed all the assemblers in the Melbourne factory. One assembler mentioned that sometimes RoboCut would reject a good piece of timber.<br />
Rose investigates this and finds that the problem started after the last software upgrade six months ago. She contacts MyCut and it claims that none of its other users have reported this problem. After some argument MyCut agrees to send Rose the algorithms related to the software changes. She finds one algorithm that has to do with the cutting process. RoboCut uses this algorithm to check whether or not a piece of timber is long enough to use.</p>
<p><strong>Function</strong> Check_Length(Timber_Length, LengthRequired) </p>
<p><strong>Begin</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>If</strong> Timber_Length &gt; Length_Required <strong>Then</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Return <strong>true</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Else</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p> Return <strong>false</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p> <strong>End if</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p> <strong>End</strong><br />
</p>
<p>Rose decides to test this algorithm by choosing a length of timber (Timber_Length) of 2.4 metres. For the other variable (Length_Required) she chooses the values 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5.</p>
<p>a. Explain why Rose selected these values.</p>
<p class="myanswer">They are boundary conditions to test the behaviour near, on, and beyond the critical point where the behaviour of the algorithm should change. Most subtle (and hard-to-find) errors tend to occur right at the point where behaviours should change, so test data should focus on that transition point. </p>
<p>3 marks - average 2.0</p>
<p class="examiner">Following is an example of an acceptable student response.<br />
<em>The values 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 test all possible number types that could occur. 2.3 is smaller then the required length, 2.4 is equal to the required length and 2.5 is greater then the required length. This comprehensively tests the algorithm.</em></p>

This type of question has traditionally been done poorly by students. This year's algorithm question, though it may have appeared less demanding, still provided many students with a challenge. Most students were able to identify and correct the error; however, many students were still unable to complete the test table correctly or explain why a certain value would be used to test the algorithm. Both of these concepts are highly important when developing software solutions and should be constantly reinforced even when developing minor or small programs throughout the course of the year.</p>

<p><strong>Question 8</strong></p>
<p>Rose recommended changes to the system's hardware and hoped to keep the software unchanged. However she now realises that there is a software fault that must also be corrected. MyCut is reluctant to believe that its software has a fault. Rose contacts some of her friends in the software industry and finds one who says he can provide her with the source code for the MyCut software. This will allow her to make her own changes to the program and correct the fault herself.<br />
Discuss the ethical and/or legal issues faced by Rose in this situation.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Ethically, she should want to do everything she could to do what she was hired to do - fix the company's IT problem. This is even more understandable considering the difficult and obstructive attitude of the software company when Rose's request is reasonable.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Legally speaking, using or modifying the software without permission would contravene the Copyright Act 1968.</p>
<p>4 marks - average 1.8</p>
<p class="comment">Be sure to name relevant laws accurately. Vague references to actions &quot;being illegal&quot; is not as convincing.</p>
<p class="examiner">For a number of years the examination has contained an ethical and/or legal-type question, and this year it continued to be answered poorly. However, many students were able to write an appropriate comment about copyright concerns. In the 2008 Assessment Report it was stated that students should 'contrast the two views and add further relevant information showing their understanding.' However, many students again did not provide this type of response. This is an area that students need to focus on during their examination preparation.<br />
The following is an example of an acceptable answer.<br />
<em>There are legal issues that face Rose in making that decision. Under the Australian Copyright law Rose would need to receive MyCut's permission for Rose to make her own modifications. Rose would also have to check the license agreement MyCut and Truss-Tee have to see if she can make modifications. Using her friend to get the software's source code is not ethically right by Rose. She is going behind the companies back and performing actions that are illegal. Rose is therefore putting Truss-Tee also in a bad position.</em></p>

<p><strong>Question 9</strong> <em>(2011-2014 - the qualities of suppliers is not relevant any more)</em></p>
<p>The new system requires a significant hardware purchase by Truss-Tee of a large format scanner for each of its factories. Two suppliers have been identified that can provide scanners with the right technical specifications for Truss-Tee at a comparable price of about $ 13,000 each. To help Truss-Tee choose between the two suppliers, identify two other factors that are important for Truss-Tee to consider and explain why these factors are important for Truss-Tee.</p>
<p>Possibilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li ><span class="myanswer">Reliability &gt; Is it likely to break down soon? Does the software crash?</span></li>
<li ><span class="myanswer">Support &gt; Does the manufacturer offer reasonable warranty and repair conditions? Does it actively upgrade firmware?</span></li>
<li ><span class="myanswer">Functionality &gt; Does the equipment have features required by the buyer (e.g. OCR)? Is its maximum resolution adequate?</span></li>
<li><span class="myanswer">Usability &gt; Is it easy and efficient to use? Can it be customised to suit users' preferences?</span></li>
<li ><span class="myanswer">Accuracy &gt; Does it produce quality output?</span></li>
<li ><span class="myanswer">Performance &gt; How long does it take to perform a scan?</span></li>
</ul>
<p>4 marks - average 1.9</p>
<p class="comment">I did include hardware/technical compatibility issues at first, but as Adrian Janson pointed out, the question did say that the scanners had the right technical specs for Truss-Tee.</p>
<p class="examiner">There were many possible answers to this question, including (but not limited to):<br />
&bull; the availability of scanners &ndash; depending on Truss-Tee's time frame they may need to choose the supplier who has them available and can supply them in the shortest time frame<br />
&bull; the location of the suppliers may be relevant in relation to the provision of warranty support, repairs and training. An overseas supplier may not have the ability to provide the same type of support as the local supplier. This would influence their choice<br />
&bull; the reliability of the suppliers will be important. A brand new company may not have the track record of a long-established company and so their reliability will need to be investigated to ensure that the goods will come through. This is also related to the level of customer service provided as this will be important for future support<br />
&bull; training requirements of the product and the training provided by the supplier may also be reasons for choosing one product over another. If the scanners are complex to set up and use, a supplier that can provide specific training may be important.</p>
<p class="examiner">This question posed similar problems to Question 6, with students appearing to misunderstand what the question was<br />
asking. They were asked to describe two factors to consider when comparing two scanners for purchase. The question<br />
stated that technical specifications and cost were the same so they should not be considered. Many students still<br />
included a technical specification in their response. Many students received no marks for this question; however, they<br />
were able to list why one mobile phone should be considered over another. Students need to have examples that relate<br />
to their reality to be able to contextualise some of the key concepts of the study design. They also need to develop a<br />
glossary of terms such as factors and specifications and synonyms that could be used in an examination.</p>

<p><strong>Question 10</strong> <em>(2011-2014 - skip this. Implementation methods are no longer relevant)</em></p>
<p>Rose believes that Truss-Tee should use a pilot changeover method to the new system. She suggests to Shaun that the Melbourne factory should be the first to change. Shaun realises that for the new system that Rose has proposed, a pilot changeover will not work.</p>
<p>a. Identify the feature of the new system that makes a pilot changeover inappropriate.</p>
<p class="myanswer">The unconverted branches' old hardware would not be compatible with the pilot branch (particularly relating to transmission speeds).</p>
<p class="myanswer"> Also, the other branches would not be able to send plans to Melbourne because they don't have scanners.</p>
<p>1 mark - average 0.3</p>
<p class="examiner">Appropriate responses included:<br />
&bull; only the Melbourne factory will have high speed Internet<br />
&bull; Melbourne can deal with graphic images but other factories cannot.</p>
<p> b. Explain why this feature makes a pilot changeover inappropriate.</p>

<p>1 mark - average 0.4</p>
<p class="examiner">Other factories will not able to receive/handle GIF files in a timely manner, therefore the new system will not function as required.</p>
<p> c. Recommend and justify a changeover method that Truss-Tee could use.</p>
<p class="myanswer">For them to work as a team, all branches would need to convert directly and simultaneously to the new system. It could not be phased in within a branch because all parts of the new system are required for it to work.
</p>
<p>2 marks - average 0.7</p>
<p class="examiner">Direct changeover &ndash; all factories will then be able to send/receive GIF files so the new system can be fully functional, unlike the pilot if only one factory has high speed Internet access.<br />
Students found this question a challenge. Many were unable to explain why the pilot changeover would be a concern 
and many responded that phased changeover would be the most appropriate method. For the new system to work all factories needed to change; this discounted any method other than a direct change in all locations. Changeover methods are a key concept with clearly defined plans of actions. Students should be able to clearly identify a method, write about it advantages and disadvantages, and suggest an appropriate method for a particular situation.</p>

<p class="examiner">Again, students found it difficult to construct clear and detailed responses. Many students were able to give examples of security such as virus checkers, a firewall, username/password (software solutions) and access protection, such as swipe card, biometric, surveillance measures, alarms, guards, etc. (physical), but many struggled to provided an explanation about how it would provide protection for the Truss-Tee information. Students need to practise writing responses that fully answer a question.</p>

<p><strong>Question 12</strong></p>
<p>Truss-Tee is establishing the evaluation criteria for the new system. The main system goal is to efficiently and effectively share the design workload between all the sites. In order to measure the success of this it has determined a number of criteria that must be met.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Criterion 1<br />
</strong>To ensure that the processing of plans takes no longer than it used to whether the work is done on-site or interstate.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Criterion 2<br />
</strong>To ensure the reliability of the system is maintained now that fewer staff will be handling the design process.</p>
<p align="left">The table below outlines the evaluation strategy Truss-Tee has put in place to measure one of these criteria. Complete the table to outline a strategy they could use to evaluate the second criterion.</p>

<td valign="top"><p>Data about when quotes are generated will give a start date for the process.

This assists in demonstrating that the goal of efficiently sharing the design workload is achieved.</p>
</td>
<td valign="top"><p class="myanswer">The number of handpassed jobs will act as a yardstick to indicate how heavily the system is being used and what workload it's under. If plans are regularly sent, it means the system has been required and is useful.</p>
<p class="myanswer">If jobs are not finished on time after being handpassed, and the delay is not caused by communication delays, it means jobs are not properly attended to at the destination branch.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Customer complaints about cutting quality indicates errors being made during design that need to be diagnosed.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Designer idle time and overtime indicates how well the load sharing is working. If some branches are overloaded and some underloaded, the sharing plan needs to be revised.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Historical data lets the new system be compared with the previous system to help isolate the causes of inefficiences or ineffectiveness.</p>

<p class="comment"><img src="/m/happydog2.gif" width="82" height="104" align="left" />With complex and potentially vague questions, I always endorse the practice of providing an example of what is required so kids aren't left playing the &quot;What the hell does the examiner want from me?&quot; game rather than demonstrating their understanding. Good examiner.</p>

<td class="red">With fewer staff doing the same workload and with extra Internet traffic the system will be under greater strain. Error logs and data showing the downtime of the system will demonstrate the system's performance<br />
under strain. Internet transmission data will show how the ystem is coping with the extra traffic. This will all help to determine whether this criterion is met and assist in demonstrating the goal of efficiently sharing the design workload.</td>

<p><span class="red">This question required students to complete the table for Criterion 2, with Criterion 1 provided as an example of what was expected. Even though Criterion 1 was modelled for students, most students were not able to complete this question. It was clear that most students found the evaluation stage of the System Development Life Cycle a challenge to understand and articulate. Many students did not provide a response to the question. Students should be encouraged to write a response for every question. This is another area that teachers should concentrate on as part of examination preparation.</span><br />
