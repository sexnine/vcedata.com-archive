<p class="comment">Let's have a look at the 2001 exam which finished about an hour ago. 
All comments here are mine alone and reflect nothing about what the examiners 
may or may not have expected.</p>
<p class="comment">On the whole, the exam was pretty easy. No really curly or downright 
weird questions. The PERTish chart in Q9 was odd, but at least it was 
readable and not difficult to interpret. Several of my students finished 
early.</p>
<p class="comment"> As usual, internet-related questions were common, so it's worth your 
while become internet-literate if you're doing IPM.</p>
<p>Historical Note: at this early stage of the post mortems I did not include the entire questions; I just paraphrased them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="comment">You are only supposed to do one of the alternatives. Don't do both, because 
the first answer will be answered and the second one ignored, no matter 
how brilliant it may have been. You should tick either the Alternative 
A box or the Alternative B box and answer in the space provided.</p>
<h4><font color="#000000">Alternative A: describe in detail how an image 
is placed on the page in a particular web authoring program that you have 
used.</font></h4>
<p class="myanswer">To place an image in a webpage using Dreamweaver 4, place the cursor 
where the picture needs to go. Press CTRL+ALT+I or select menu Insert 
&gt; Image. Use the standard Windows file dialog box to navigate to the 
picture file and click the &quot;Select&quot; button.</p>
<p class="comment">Since the question's instructions specified &quot;describe in detail&quot;, 
you would want to be very detailed and produce a description that could 
be followed to successfully insert an image. Note that the &quot;particular 
web authoring program&quot; is named in the answer.</p>
<h4><font color="#000000">Alternative B: List a software tool you have used 
and describe two methods of electronic data validation.</font></h4>
<p>Example answer 1: <span class="myanswer">Microsoft Excel 2000. </span></p>
<p>Method 1: <span class="myanswer">In the Data &gt; Validation menu you can specify what values 
are allowed in a cell or range (e.g. text, date). A specified message 
can be made to appear when the cell is selected and if validation rules 
are broken.</span></p>
<p>Method 2: <span class="myanswer">A formula could be written to check the contents of another 
cell. e.g. if the value in cell A1 is not allowed to be negative, this 
formula in B1 would highlight the error</span></p>
<p class="myanswer">=if(A1&lt;0,&quot;Error in cell A1&quot;,&quot;&quot;)</p>
<hr />
<p>Example answer 2: <span class="myanswer">Microsoft Word 2000.</span></p>
<p>Method 1: <span class="myanswer">By running a spell check, Word finds all words in the document 
that are not in its dictionary. It will detect typing and spelling errors, 
unless the error by chance matches a legitimate word (e.g. if you typed 
&quot;There&quot; instead of &quot;Their&quot;, or if you typed &quot;bag&quot; 
instead of &quot;big&quot;.)</span></p>
<p>Method 2: <span class="myanswer">By running a grammar check, Word will check your writing 
for grammatical errors such as &quot;They is good&quot;. It can also detect 
possibly poor writing style such as partial sentences or passive voice.</span></p>

<p class="myanswer">Chairs or desks of the wrong height can cause strain to back, arm 
and leg muscles. Reaching up to a desk that is too high will strain the 
arms. If the monitor is raised too high, the neck can be strained. If 
a chair lacks lumbar support, the back can start hurting. If a chair is 
too high and the user's feet do not touch the ground, discomfort can result.</p>

<p class="question"> A tutoring business lets school students employ 
someone to help them, either at home or elsewhere, for $28 an hour. Tutors 
are sent a weekly email with an attached file telling them what their 
appointments are for the coming week.</p>
<p class="question">6a) There are two boxes, each containing a list 
of possible input data items for a business information system. You had 
to tick the item in each list that would be the least essential.</p>
<p class="myanswer">On the student data side, obviously for this case study, the tutor needs 
to know the student's name and address. The subject is necessary because 
tutors probably could teach more than one subject. When the appointment 
is scheduled is also vital. The only one left is the gender of 
the student.</p>
<p><font size="2" class="comment">Pedantic note: Languages have &quot;genders.&quot; Humans 
have &quot;sex.&quot; Yeah. Stop giggling. That's why people say &quot;gender&quot;, 
I suppose. ;-) </font></p>
<p class="myanswer">On the tutor data side, one would logically need all the fields (including 
email address since information is sent by email) except &quot;Other 
employers&quot; which would not be useful for organising tutorials.</p>

<p class="question">&quot;Note: only weekdays included&quot; 
<span class="comment">(thank heaven, after last year's mess on the Gantt chart!)</span></p>
<p class="question">9a) &quot;If the design team cannot agree on 
the steps involved in testing and the task takes two extra days what impact 
will this have on the critical path of the project?&quot;</p>
<p class="myanswer">It must be referring to the top left box &quot;Write the steps...&quot;. 
That task is on a path on its lonesome, taking 5 days. The alternative, 
concurrent path, &quot;Identify...(2) &quot; + &quot;Advertise (10)&quot; 
+ &quot;Select (5)&quot; adds up to 17 days before the two paths converge 
again at the mysterious empty box. In other words, there are 12 slack 
days for the top left task. If the &quot;Write the steps&quot; tasks 
now takes 7 days, it is still TEN DAYS shorter than the longer path below 
(i.e. 10 days' slack), so the short answer is NO IMPACT.</p>
<p class="question">9b) &quot;What task would be shown in the empty 
box?&quot;</p>
<p class="myanswer">Well, it's a no-brainer. Everything before the empty box is about setting 
up testing. Everything after it is about fixing errors that were found 
by testing. What's missing? TESTING!</p>
<p class="question">9c) &quot;What is the maximum number of days 
the task &quot;select testers&quot; could take if the critical path cannot 
be changed?&quot;</p>
<p class="myanswer">Since &quot;Select testers&quot; is <b>on the critical path</b> (it is 
part of the longest path from beginning to end), the easy answer is FIVE 
DAYS (i.e. no change, since any change to the task would change the 
critical path.) It's a bit of a trick question!</p>
<p class="comment">Thank Dog this question was much more reasonable than last year's! You're 
a lucky bunch of Vegemites compared to the kids who were the IPM 2000 
guinea pigs.</p>

each store providing the total sales by department for the current week, 
the previous week and the year so far. A copy of the report for the relevant 
store is given to the store manager and each department head. Explain 
how each of these people would use the report (2 marks - 4 lines)</p>
<p class="myanswer">The store manager [tactical management level] would use the report 
to see how individual departments were performing and help plan tactical 
changes to departments. The manager could support (or scare) the department 
head into better results; or praise (or reward) the department head for 
his/her good results. The manager could reorganise resources and training 
to aid departments that were underperforming and inspect high-performing 
departments to learn their secrets of success. The store manager's changes 
would be aimed at improving department heads' implementation of the company's 
goals.</p>
<p class="myanswer">The department head [operational managment level] would use the report 
to better manage the day-to-day operation of the department; discover 
whether workers were performing well or poorly and adjust how workers 
were supervised or resourced. The department head's changes would be practical 
changes at a worker level.</p>

<p class="question">An organisation sells art and craft supplies, 
and is divided into departments. One person in each department has been 
given responsibility of overseeing the development of webages which will 
display products, prices and staff contact information. The system administrator 
has suggested students from local schools be engaged to develop the pages. 
Each department has been assigned students from a different school. It 
is expected that the students will work at times that suit them and that 
the pages will be developed independently.</p>
<p><font color="#000000">a) Explain three weaknesses in this approach</font></p>
<ol>
<li class="myanswer"> Pages might not be ready when they are required - if they <b>ever</b> 
appear</li>
<li class="myanswer"> Each page will look different, lending a messy appearance to 
the site</li>
<li class="myanswer"> The students' skill levels may not be up to the professional 
job expected of an organisation</li>
</ol>
<p class="question">b) Who would you suggest tests the solution 
and why would you choose this person?</p>
<p class="myanswer">The system adminstrator should test the solution since he/she would 
understand the technical requirements of the website and notice any shortcomings 
in the pages supplied. He/she would know what to test for to detect typical 
problems with webpages. The administrator would also be able to compare 
the departments' pages and see if they are consistent in style and content.</p>

<p class="question">A town has 2 hospitals. Only one of them has 
an X-ray unit and the hospitals are considering sharing some other facilities 
wuch as their pharmacies and kitchens. Some doctors work at both hospitals 
and some patients attend both hospitals. A communications link has been 
proposed to connect the computer systems in both hospitals.</p>
<p>15a) What would be one of the organisational 
goals of a hospital in the town?</p>
<p class="myanswer">To provide effective and efficient treatment of patients' illnesses.</p>
<p class="question">The hospitals have decided to set up a common 
patient admissions and medical history database.</p>
<p>15b) State what data item(s) would allow the 
hospitals to uniquely identify each patient.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Medicare card number </p>
<p class="myanswer"><em>(In 2001 the Privacy Act was not part of the study design, and I didn't know that organisations were not allowed to use an identifier from another organisation's database to identify an individual)</em></p>
<p class="myanswer">surname + given name + phone number</p>
<p class="comment">(In 2001, databases were not part of the study design either, and I was not so aware that using multiple fields to define a key leaves one vulnerable to Second Normal Form [2NF] normalisation problems)</p>
<p class="myanswer">etc (so long as there is no chance of even million-to-one chances of 
duplicate identities)</p>
<p class="question">15c) Give two examples of data, other than patient 
details, that the two hospitals may wish to share.</p>
<p><span class="myanswer">1. Bookings of X-ray machine usage</span> <span class="comment">(it is suggested in the case 
study)</span></p>
<p><span class="myanswer">2. Drugs given to patients by pharmacies</span> <span class="comment">(to stop drug-seeking 
patients)</span></p>

a kitchen)</span></p>
<p class="question">15d) Name and describe the functions of one 
active hardware component that would be essential in the network to enable 
applications and information to be accessed from workstations in the other 
hospital.</p>
<p><font color="#000000" class="comment">This is an example of a question that separates

<p class="question">The hospital administrators suggest that the 
database should be read-only for all users and only the data entry clerks 
in each hospital can change or add records.</p>
<p class="question">15e) State one reason why doctors should not 
be allowed to change or add data</p>
<ul>
<li class="myanswer">They could unwittingly add patients who are already in the database 
if they were unaware the patient was already registered.</li>
<li class="myanswer">They could illicitly add &quot;phantom&quot; patients, prescribe them 
narcotics and use their drugs for their own purposes.</li>
<li class="myanswer">They would not know the proper procedures for adding patients and 
make faulty admissions</li>

<p class="question">A company is small, but rapidly growing. In 
the past, staff have been given an allowance to purchase their own computer 
equipment. This worked well at first, since staff could select the type 
of computer they liked best. However, management has become worried that 
as the company expands, there is no consistency in the technology being 
bought by the employees. Management and staff have agreed that as from 
next year the company would buy computers for all staff members.</p>
<p>16a) List two methods that could be used to 
gather the data needed to enable the company to determine the specifications 
for the computers to be purchased.</p>
<ol>
<li class="myanswer"> Study the quantities and types of data handled by the computers 
and determine the specifications to suit the data handled</li>
<li class="myanswer"> Record the performance of different hardware types used by different 
employees compared with their efficiency in processing data</li>
<li class="myanswer"> Interview employees about their satisfaction with the processing 
abilities of their systems</li>
</ol>
<p class="question">16b) Explain why it is necessary for the company 
to evaluate a range of solutions before selecting an option.</p>
<p class="myanswer">The company must find the cheapest but most effective solution, and 
by evaluating a variety of solutions, they should discover the optimal 
solution. They can uncover weaknesses and strengths in solutions they 
had previously not known about.</p>
<p class="question">16c) Another company has offered to provide 
a networked solution. Suggest two changeover procedures that could be 
considered and justify one of the two alternatives.</p>
<ol>
<li class="myanswer"> Direct conversion</li>
<li class="myanswer"> Pilot conversion</li>
</ol>
<p class="comment">(Parallel does not really make sense in this case study.) Thanks to Mark 
Scott of Billanook for feedback on my answers to this question.</p>
<p class="question">Justification:</p>
<p class="myanswer">With a direct changeover scheme, the conversion is quick and system 
improvements can be enjoyed immediately by everyone. Direct conversion 
is cheaper and less complicated than alternative strategies.</p>
<p class="comment">or</p>
<p class="myanswer">With a phased changeover, parts of the new system can be introduced 
in stages. In this way, staff will not be overwhelmed by change, and disruptions 
to the organisation will be reduced if changes are made bit by bit. They 
could introduce the new workstations first, then phase in the network 
once the workstations are in place and staff are comfortable with them. 
By debugging each new part of the system before introducing the next one, 
system reliabilty is enhanced.</p>

<p class="question">The Chief Executive Office of a book company 
has said that the company must always aim to meet the organisation's goal 
of 'providing customers with a fast, reliable, personalised service.' 
The South Melbourne store manager believes that an in-store computer facility, 
where customers can search the company's stocks, will improve customer 
satisfaction and provide a faster service. The staff at the store have 
objected to this, saying it will not provide personalised service. Previously, 
the store's staff would search the company database when a customer made 
a request for a book.</p>
<p>17a) If the CEO approves a trial of the computer 
facility, explain one data security or training requirement that will 
need to be addressed.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Data security: they will need to ensure that customer use of the database 
could not alter or delete database records.</p>
<p class="comment">or</p>
<p class="myanswer">Training: they would need to train staff so they knew how to show 
customers how to use the customer database.</p>
<p class="question">17b) Explain why using a computer terminal may 
not meet the company's goal.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Since one of the company's organisational goals is &quot;personalised&quot; 
service, it would not be good if the terminal removed the personal staff/customer 
relationship.</p>
<p class="question">17c) Customer response to the trial has been 
positive and the CEO wants to install an in-store facility across all 
stores. Identify and explain in detail one requirement, apart from 
the cost and requirement answered in part a above, that would need 
to be considered before implementing the change.</p>
<p class="question">Requirement: <span class="myanswer">Compatibility with 
existing equipment, health and safety of staff and customers.</span></p>
<p class="question">17d) Recommend an evaluation strategy for determining 
the success of the change.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Monitor sales, to see if they increase. Monitor complaints by customers 
about poor service or inability to find what they want. Review profit 
statistics over time. Study costs of implementation of terminals and database 
maintenance. </p>

<p>More and more organisations are providing 
access to the Internet from their Local Area Network (LAN) so that employees 
may use email and the Internet. Discuss the risks this creates for the 
organisation and some of the strategies that might be adopted to minimise 
these risks.</p>
<p class="comment">This is an interesting style of question: it is more of an essay. Still, 
you have several things you could have talked about.</p>
<p class="myanswer">1. Viruses - from email or program attachments could infiltrate the 
server and workstations, destroying data, disclosing data, interfering 
with normal operations. Strategies would include training of users in 
the wise handling of attachments, installing and regularly upgrading and 
running virus and trojan scanners.</p>
<p class="myanswer">2. Hacking from outside - firewalls, either software or hardware, 
would need to be installed to prevent ne'er do wells trying to break into 
the organisation's system from the outside. </p>
<p class="myanswer">3. Misuse of resources - staff may spend more time playing online 
games and searching for pornography than actually working. The organisation 
could install filters to prevent certain sites being accessed or certain 
types of text being downloaded. They could monitor emails to check that 
they were work-related. They would also want to regularly scan network 
directories to ensure improper material was not being stored on the network.</p>
<p class="myanswer">4. Sexual harassment cases - staff who upset others with sexually-explicit 
pictures or text downloaded from the internet could cause legal worries 
for the organisation.</p>
<p class="myanswer">5. Spam - could clog the mailboxes of staff and slow work-related 
internet operations. Staff would need to be instructed not to sign up 
for trivial email deliveries, and they would be wise to install email 
filters to automatically kill-file mail from known spammers.</p>
<p class="myanswer">6. Health and safety - with staff spending more time at their computers, 
there is increased risk of Occupational Health and Safety issues - RSI, 
carpal tunnel syndrome, sore necks and eyes etc. The organisation would 
want to instruct staff in good work practices and provide ergonomic furniture 
and equipment to avoid later claims for injuries incurred.</p>
<p class="myanswer">7. Costs - the organisation runs the risk of running up large bills 
for internet access and downloads. They would want to monitor their costs 
and take action when costs became too high.</p>
<p class="myanswer">8. If the organisation became dependent on internet and email access 
to do business, technical failure could be catastrophic. They would want 
to ensure their equipment was reliable, and perhaps have a backup internet 
connection (even just a dialup modem) for emergencies.</p>
<p class="comment">There are probably others I haven't thought of. If you made a point and 
could justify it, you would be credited with marks.</p>
