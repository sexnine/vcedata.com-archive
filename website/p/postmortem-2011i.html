<td><p>From the examiners' report's opening remarks</p>
<p class="examiner">The examiner says: Generally, students understood that good data produces relevant and accurate information, and they identified the 
appropriate data types, validation techniques and software functions to achieve this. They also described and named a 
comprehensive range of security equipment and procedures to protect data and information to meet various legal 
obligations. Less well understood was the need to provide a comprehensive testing strategy during the development 
stage of the problem-solving methodology. </p>
<p class="examiner"> For the first time in this study students were asked to provide a comprehensive solution to an information problem in 
the form of an extended response. </p>
<p class="examiner">Many students provided lengthy and accurate descriptions of either a database or 
spreadsheet layout for appropriately selected data but failed to complete the task by naming functions that would 
ultimately provide the required information. </p>
<p class="examiner">Very few responses then identified data to test the functions named or 
processes described or even outlined a testing strategy. Teachers are reminded that lists of the functions to be studied 
are published on the VCAA website. </p>
<p class="examiner"> It was very pleasing to see that the majority of students used a range of tools to represent both the appearance of 
solutions and the relationships between elements in solutions. Many students, for example, successfully used an 
annotated sketch to enhance their answer to the extended response question.</p>
<p class="examiner"> In many instances where full marks were gained students provided well-thought-out examples to clarify their 
descriptions, explanations and recommendations. Words such as &quot;list&#8223;, &quot;describe&#8223;, &quot;explain&#8223;, &quot;discuss&#8223; and &quot;recommend&#8223; require appropriate responses. </p>

<p > A.<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/indent.lbi" -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp; a set of three text boxes.<br />

<p >Answer is B. </p>
<p class="myanswer">Explanation - checkboxes allows any or all of the items to be selected. <br />
Text boxes are hard to validate since they can contain all sorts of content; a dropdown list only allows one item to be selected. Printing a form to be filled in by hand and then entered electronically is very inefficient.</p>

<p > Answer is A. </p>
<p class="myanswer">Explanation - A router allows networks to connect, and it acts as a firewall to protect a LAN against the other networks (including the rest of the internet.) Switches connect devices within a LAN. A WAP lets wireless devices connect to a wired LAN. A NIC does the same for a non-wireless device.</p>

Typically these include cost, speed of processing, requirements of users, security, compatibility, level of expertise, capacity and availability of equipment. </p>
<p > Answer is D. </p>
<p class="myanswer">Explanation - &lt;A&gt; is done after implementation, during evaluation. <br />
&lt;B&gt; is confusing. Analysis <em>does</em> involve data collection, but what do the criteria relate to? Is it evaluation again?<br />
</p>
<p class="myanswer"><em>According to VCAA, determining evaluation criteria is done during design. Dog knows why, but that's what they reckon. So it's not &lt;C&gt;<br />

<p > Answer is A. </p>
<p class="myanswer">Explanation - the primary key is the key field(s) in the current table (Y). The foreign key is the corresponding key in the related table (Z). So if you're in table Y, the foreign table is Z and the key field there is I. From table Z's point of view, field I is the primary key and field D in table Y is the foreign key. I think.</p>

<p class="myanswer">Explanation - this was a nicely interesting one. At first sight you mutter, &quot;But you can't tell just from <em>that</em>. You need to know...&quot; but then you look at the sample data. You see 0004 repeated in the CoachID field. That means that the values are not unique and, by definition, it can't be a key field. You check the other fields: all of them except PlayerID have duplicate values. So the only field with unique values, PlayerID, must be the primary key field. I liked this question.</p>

<p class="myanswer">Explanation - repeat after me children: the word &quot;data&quot; is plural; &quot;datum&quot; is the singular. So &quot;all data <strong>are</strong> reasonable&quot;. One Illiteracy Award, please... </p>
<p class="myanswer"><span class="red"><img src="/m/illiterate.jpg" alt="" width="47" height="89" /></span></p>
<p class="myanswer">Anyway, validation only checks that data are reasonable, not that they're accurate. e.g. if you filled in that you were 14 years old and you were actually 15, there is no way any validation could tell it was wrong. However if you said you were 239, &quot;cat&quot; or -3 year old, validation could flag that as unreasonable. &lt;B&gt; and &lt;D&gt; would be discovered by testing.</p>

D.<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/indent.lbi" -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp; poultry production rates in Victoria 2007-2010 </p>
<p > Answer is B. </p>
<p class="myanswer">Explanation - this is not an easy one. Personally, I would have viewed the establishment of a new location as a big <em>strategic</em> decision, but the question insists it's tactical so you learn to live with that and move on. </p>
<p class="myanswer">You think about the scope of tactical decisions: they are measured in months, so long term profit objectives &lt;C&gt; are not relevant as they are clearly <em>strategic</em> and not tactical. &lt;D&gt; is irrelevant to the internal decision making of the business on this issue. That leaves &lt;A&gt; and &lt;B&gt;. Monthly sales could show that sales are good enough to deserve a second location, so I'd choose that. Sure, more sales will improve yearly profits, but you wouldn't need to know the current profits before deciding to open the second location.</p>
<p class="myanswer"><em>A question that takes a bit of thought. I always dread the strategic/tactical/operational question in exams: they're rarely clear-cut.</em></p>

<td><p ><strong>Question 10</strong></p>
<p > Sandra manages a Victorian local council's communication projects. She has obtained from a friend a copy of a customer database belonging to a large sports gear company.<br />
Sandra wants to promote the council's new recreation centre and asks the IT project officer of her website to create a mailing list from the customer database so she can mail vouchers to the homes of potential members of the recreation centre. The legislation the IT project officer should cite to convince Sandra her idea is a bad one is<br />

D.<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/indent.lbi" -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp; Information Privacy Act 2000.</em></p>
<p > Answer is maybe D.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Explanation - this is a hairy question, and your knowledge of the legislation need to be pretty keen. The Spam Act forbids the sending of unsolicited commercial email but <em>snail mail is not email</em>, so it's not spam! So if it's not that, what law applies? </p>
<p class="myanswer">How she got the data is unclear, and whether the data could be said to be copyrighted is dubious. </p>
<p class="myanswer">The Health Records Act would apply to any Victorian organisation that held health data, but the sports gear database would not contain such data. Strike out &lt;C&gt;. </p>
<p class="myanswer">The IPA affects Victorian public service departments - does that include councils, I wonder? The IPA basically repeats the federal Privacy Act's privacy principles, but none of them seem to me to apply here. Using data for a secondary purpose than that for which it was originally collected? That's probably as close as we can get.</p>
<p class="myanswer"><em>Did the examiners really mean to specify the vouchers are sent by snail mail, or did they mess it up during editing?</em></p>
<p class="examiner">State average - 45% - official answer was D.</p>
<p class="examiner">The examiner says: The SPAM Act 2003 refers to electronic mail. This

<p > Answer is B. </p>
<p class="myanswer">Explanation - Yes, folks. You got it wrong. &quot;This is easy,&quot; you smirked. But you didn't realise that <em>text</em> data is sorted alphabetically, not numerically. So a &quot;6&quot; always comes after a &quot;1&quot;, and &quot;11&quot; comes alphabetically <em>before</em> &quot;6&quot;. So &quot;34&quot; comes <em>before</em> &quot;6&quot;. You may notice this sometimes when looking at files starting with numbers shown in a file manager. That's why clever people use leaving zeroes to force correct sorting. Moral: Always look for the sting in the tail of an &quot;easy&quot; question.</p>

D.<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/indent.lbi" -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp; Is it cheaper to use the online backup than the removable hard drives?</p>
<p > Answer is B. But it's wrong.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Explanation - this question is odd in more than one way. Why would any business do away with full backups? It's insane. How could you recover your data if only new or changed data is ever being backed up? However, the question is trying to see if you know what <strong>effectiveness</strong> means.</p>
<p class="myanswer"> &lt;A&gt; is ease of use, which the study design says is efficiency. I disagree, but let's not gnaw old bones here.<br />
&lt;C&gt; is speed, which is also efficiency. <br />
&lt;D&gt; is cost, which is also efficiency. </p>
<p class="myanswer">That leaves &lt;B&gt;, but it's wrong. If only <em>incremental</em> backups are being done, only new and changed data will be backed up. Existing data will <em>not</em> be copied to the online backup. So, checking that &quot;<strong>all</strong> the data&quot; is backed up will not happen. Only new and changed data will be backed up online a the end of each week.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Perhaps the examiner meant to say &quot;Is all of the data that <em>should be</em> backed up actually backed up at the end of each week?&quot; It's badly worded, and confusing, and the premise is ridiculous.</p>

was allocated if the students could explain how this feature contributed to the effectiveness of the webpage. <br />
Relevance, 
as a measure of effectiveness, was explained in terms of the use of &quot;bold and reserve font to show the main information 
groups on the website&#8223;. <br />
Completeness, as a measure of effectiveness, was explained in terms of &quot;tables used to give a 
complete list of important information headings&#8223;. <br />
Accepted responses included &quot;links displayed in bolded, white font on 
black&#8223; and &quot;links underlined&#8223;. Many other responses were also accepted. These referred to left, centre or right 
&quot;alignment of particular elements&#8223;, the &quot;orientation of groups of links&#8223;, the proportion or hierarchy evident in the 
&quot;arrangement of titles-subtitles-links&#8223;, &quot;the consistency in font style&#8223; or colour and contrast used to emphasise &quot;hierarchy 
of titles-subtitles-links&#8223;.</p>
<p >b.&nbsp;&nbsp; Recommend a test that could be used to ensure that the forum performs as it should for members. Justify your answer.</p>
<p class="myanswer" >Typical member users should be asked to enter the forum and perform all of the functions supported by the forum (e.g. creating a post, editing a post, reading posts). They should report any features that do not behave as expected. Using typical users (rather than using managers, technicians etc) will better demonstrate the forum's performance when being used by real users.</p>

</p><p class="examiner" >The examiner says: Many students recognised that implementing such procedures against staff wishes would affect staff morale. Examples 
included &quot;honest employees will think the hospital doesn&#8223;t trust them and not work as hard&#8223; and &quot;hackers will find other 
ways of getting the data out anyway&#8223;. Other students suggested &quot;the hospital&#8223;s reputation would suffer&#8223; first because of 
the data theft and secondly because &quot;the staff were unhappy and going on strike&#8223;.
</p><p>
c. The hospital decided to implement the new policy. A manager is checking the emails when he reads that one staff member is planning to take a sick day and go to the beach. The manager is faced with an ethical dilemma. Explain what the manager should consider before deciding whether to talk to the employee.</p>
<p class="myanswer" >This knowledge was gained accidentally when trying to solve the completely different problem of data theft. The manager has to consider whether it is morally more right to punish the staff using this 'fruit of the poisoned tree' information, or whether whether the tainted information should be used for the benefit of the organisation. Not using it respects the staff member's privacy but hurts the hospital, and vice versa.

<p class="examiner" > 
The examiner says: Responses generally included two or three steps in a procedure the hospital could follow. Typically, these covered 
communicating with staff, checking physical security and upgrading protective software. For example, &quot;the hospital 
should explain the legal obligation to secure patient data&#8223; or &quot;discuss possible solutions with all the employees&#8223;. They 
could check all security procedures &quot;with staff assistance, and make any changes that might help&#8223;. And very frequently 
&quot;use electronic tagging and see if there is some way of tracking data&#8223; and &quot;tighten up the passwords so that only certain 
people can access patient data&#8223;. </p>

<p class="examiner" >The examiner says: Most students described a security procedure the golf club could use and gave an example of the protection it provided. 
Successful responses included &quot;a member ID given by the club and then a strong password chosen by the member&#8223; or &quot;a 
firewall or antivirus software to stop hackers stealing members&#8223; private details&#8223; or &quot;use secure banking like PayPal&#8223; 
when members&#8223; fees are paid online by credit card. This question was well answered. </p>
<p >d. The online space for members will allow them to discuss the rules of golf. Some members have suggested a wiki, others a forum. Would you recommend a forum or a wiki? Justify your answer. Indicate your preference with a tick.<!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/indent.lbi" -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->&nbsp; </p>
<p class="myanswer" ><strong>Forum</strong> - The aim is to discuss, which a forum is very good at. It allows threaded question/answer/replies on different topics. A wiki, on the other hand, is meant as a tool to collate knowledge into a single document. It does not support discussion.</p>

</p><p class="examiner" >The examiner says: Students who chose a forum over a wiki were able to provide two very direct reasons for their selection. For example, &quot;a 
forum will let members have their say in a conversation-like manner&#8223; and &quot;a wiki is more formal and might frighten 
some members out of stating their opinion&#8223;. 
</p><p class="examiner" > Others explained that the editing/referencing protocols of a wiki might 
make discussion &quot;more difficult for ordinary members and a forum would be easier for discussion&#8223;. Those who argued 
for a wiki over a forum typically suggested that a wiki would be best because &quot;rules need a regulated environment for 
discussion&#8223;. Other responses which argued a case in the context of the golf club also received a mark.

<td><p >Question 11</p>
<p > A team of seven biologists researching the eating habits and movements of koalas in a national park send descriptions, images and maps to each other and to head office while the biologists are working.</p>
<p > The team currently uses digital cameras to capture images and wireless laptops to input data and email attachments to head office. At the end of each day the data on each laptop is backed up to a removable hard disk carried in a backpack by one of the biologists.</p>
<p class="myanswer" ><em>If the biologists are not working in the same location, please explain how one of them will back up the data on each of the laptops. If they are all working in the same location, why do they need to send stuff to each other by wireless?</em></p>
<p > Head office has suggested that the biologists use cloud computing to back up their data as it is collected.</p>
<p >a.&nbsp;&nbsp; Explain how this suggestion could improve the timeliness of their data.</p>
<p class="myanswer" >Because the data is stored centrally as it's entered, it's immediately available to each of the biologists and head office as soon as it's required.</p>

</p><p class="examiner" >The examiner says: Most students could explain that data saved directly to the cloud is backed up as it is recorded and therefore available to 
other team members or head office almost immediately. Typically accepted responses included &quot;data will be available to 
teams more quickly and will be more up-to-date&#8223;.
</p><p>
b.&nbsp;&nbsp; State a criterion for evaluating the communication of image data to the cloud.</p>

<p ><span class="red">The examiner says: Most accepted responses presented a criterion in the form of a question comparing the quality of new and old images. 
Examples included, &quot;Are the images using the cloud the same resolution?&#8223; and &quot;Are the new images as clear as the old 
images?&#8223; 
Responses which compared the download speed, ease of retrieval or security of images were also accepted.</span></p>
<p > The biologists are worried that criminals will intercept their data and use it to trap koalas for illegal zoos.</p>
<p >c.&nbsp;&nbsp; Recommend equipment to prevent criminal access to the data as it is communicated.<span class="myanswer"></span></p>
<p class="myanswer" ><em>Encrypt the data before it's sent (e.g. with Pretty Good Privacy which uses RSA public key encryption)</em></p>
<p class="myanswer" ><em>Use a cloud host which supports SSL or TLS connections.</em></p>
<p class="myanswer" ><em>Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) box to securely connect to the cloud host.</em></p>

<p class="examiner" >The examiner says: Many students received a mark for stating that encrypting the data would protect it from hackers during communication. 
Complete answers included an explanation such as &quot;encryption scrambles the data and makes it unreadable to hackers&#8223; 
or &quot;data is encrypted with a key before it is sent and only users with the key will be able to decrypt and read the data&#8223;. </p>
