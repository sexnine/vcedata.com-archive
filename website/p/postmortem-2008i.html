The decision is strategic, that is, it is made by senior management and involves forward planning over a three year period. <br />
It is a goal because it is
long-term and it is general because it does not provide a target figure. <br />
A large minority of students selected option D. This is an objective because it is a small achievable task with a given target figure. It is a task undertaken to achieve the goal. In this case for example, an objective could be a 5 per cent reduction in customer complaints 
about mislabelled products.

<p align="left"> To show changes over a 4-week period in the total cash taken each Friday the most effective chart type would be<br />
A. pie.<br />
B. area.<br />
C. scatter.<br />
D. column. </p>
<p><span class="myanswer">Answer is: D
</span></p>
<p><span class="comment">Again, eliminating the unlikely answers helps a lot. It's not a pie (which shows how much the components contribute to a whole). I'm not familiar with area chart, since my experiences with mathematics at school were not happy ones. I doubt it's a scatter graph, which has dots all over it showing individual values. Column seems right.

<p class="examiner">3a. Students were asked to identify a formatting feature that added clarity to the information presented in a table. Successful responses included formatting features such as bold headings, centred headings and the shading of alternating rows. Most students explained that these formatting features added clarity because they allowed users to distinguish between the visual elements. For example, bolding makes &lsquo;important text stand out&rsquo;, shading rows &lsquo;leads the eye&rsquo; to the correct information and left justify &lsquo;stops confusion and crowding on the screen&rsquo; for the user.</p>
<p class="examiner">3b. In the second part of the question students were asked to identify two conventions and explain how each convention added to the usability of the information product. Many responses did not receive full marks for this part of the question because the conventions identified and the explanations given were not clear. Successful explanations typically conveyed the idea that the convention made the information more easily accessible to the users because it was a widely accepted and established way of presenting the particular type of information. Setting two decimal places for the money<br />
column and placing the unit kilograms or the dollar sign in the heading of a column were the most common examples of conventions. A number of students identified the &lsquo;check box&rsquo; or &lsquo;star rating&rsquo; as a formatting feature or convention. These responses were successful where there was a clear explanation of how these features added to the clarity as a formatting feature or usability as a convention.</p>

<p class="myanswer">This was a bit of a bugger. Not easy to understand what the examiners really wanted to hear. This, I imagine will turn out to be the lowest-scoring question of the paper so far.</p>
<p>i. Doctor</p>
<ul>
<li class="myanswer">If you disagreed with the Health Commission's request, would you refuse to obey it, and what consequences might you face?</li>
<li class="myanswer">If you objected to the government's request, would you rather destroy the health records than hand them over to the commission?</li>
<li class="myanswer">Even if you disagreed with the request, would you nevertheless comply if the information led to progress in healthcare for 18 year olds?</li>
</ul>
<p>ii. Patient</p>
<ul>
<li class="myanswer">If your records could lead to better healthcare for people like you, would you provide your records even if you didn't like the idea?</li>
</ul>
<p>iii. Health Commissioner</p>
<ul>
<li class="myanswer">If you received this information, would you be tempted to use it to monitor doctors' Medicare payments or other purposes?</li>
<li class="myanswer">If an 18 year old refused to let the doctor provide the information, would you prosecute or punish the 18 year old, or the doctor?</li>
</ul>
<p><em class="myanswer">Nope. Didn't like this question at all. Ethical questions are always murky.</em></p><em class="myanswer">
<p><span class="red">State average was 0.35 / 3 (11%)</span> - <span class="myanswer">A shocking result!</span></p>
<p class="examiner">When asked to compose questions that parents of a patient would ask the doctor, the patient and the Australian Health Commission, many students responded by providing a question that would help the patient&rsquo;s parents understand a legal position rather than an ethical dilemma. A dilemma is a choice between two equally undesirable choices. In most instances the responses that received full marks made it clear that the parents were weighing up their child&rsquo;s right to privacy against the benefits to society. The following examples are from successful responses.</p>
<p class="examiner">Question 4di.- 
Parents to doctor: 
Do you benefit from sending my child&rsquo;s medical records?<br />
Question 4dii. - 
Parents to patient: 
We want to make sure your rights are protected but are you comfortable for us to see your records?<br />
Question 4diii. - 
Parents to the Australian Health Commission: We want our child&rsquo;s privacy protected but will their medical records help research or save the lives of other people?</p>
<p>e. The hospital has implemented a firewall to ensure that the medical records database is not accessed by unauthorised users. 
Describe one advantage of a firewall for the hospital. Give an example to support your answer.</p>
<p class="myanswer">The firewall prevents hackers detecting the computer and possibly activating trojan horses that might send files, log keystrokes, or force the computer to become a &quot;zombie&quot; in a spam flood or Distributed Denial of Service attack. For example, if a hacker tried to make the computer send its keystroke log, the firewall would prevent the trojan transmitting through the firewall.</p>
<p class="myanswer">An odd sort of question. The question tells us what the firewall does, and then asks why it's an advantage. Pretty basic sort of stuff.</p>
<p class="myanswer"><span class="red">State average was 1 / 2 (50%)</span></p>
<p class="examiner">Most students recognised that a firewall prevents access to the network from users outside the network. Many students were able to obtain full marks by describing a situation where the hospital firewall checked the identity of users or the content of information trying to enter the hospital network.</p>
<p>f. Describe one disadvantage of the firewall being the only way of preventing unauthorised access to the medical records database. Give an example to support your answer.</p>
<p class="myanswer">The firewall only protects from people outside the LAN. It does not protect against people inside the LAN, and it does not protect the database from unauthorised access. For example, any person within the hospital could enter the database and change, steal or delete information. Appropriate protection would be password protection of the database, preferably with hierarchical levels of access depending on people's needs.</p>
<p class="myanswer"><span class="red">State average was 0.95 / 2 (48%)</span></p>
<p class="examiner">Fewer students could identify the limitations of the firewall and describe situations where users inside the network gained illegal access to records. Many students successfully recommended that antivirus software and physical barriers should stand alongside firewalls as part of a security strategy.</p>

<p><strong>Question 5 - </strong>2 marks</p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong><img src="/m/pm/08i-b5.jpg" width="403" height="123" /></p>
<p>The close icon (which is red) on the screen shown above is described by a graphic designer as intuitive. Do you agree with the graphic designer? Justify your answer.</p>
<p class="myanswer">I agree with the designer. Red is associated by Western cultures with danger, threat, alert, so most of us would recognise that a red button demands respect. This assumption might not apply in other cultures where (for example) the funereal colour is white and wedding dresses are not white.</p>
<p class="myanswer">But as a student of mine, who is smarter than a sack of spanners, said: &quot;What does intuitive mean?&quot; Once again, it's a term we grown-ups in long trousers might be familiar with, but how many students had to guess the meaning of the question?</p>
<p class="myanswer"><span class="red">State average was 1.1 / 2 (55%)</span></p>
<p class="examiner">Students were asked to comment on the notion that a given icon was intuitive, that is, resulting from direct knowledge or awareness without conscious attention or reasoning. Responses that conveyed a notion of an intuitive icon allowing users to confidently navigate the information product without needing words were successful. Typically these responses included the phrases &lsquo;yes, the colour red means stop or danger in nature and many situations in society&rsquo; and &lsquo;the cross 
means stop or not&rsquo; when used with &lsquo;other symbols&rsquo;.</p>

<p>a. Recommend a data type for the ProductID field. Justify your answer.</p>
<p>a. 2 marks, 3 lines.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Number, integer. The field's contents are purely numeric so it will hold numbers well. Specifying a number type can make data storage more efficient.</p>
<p class="myanswer">And before we get to part b, let me wish the examiners luck marking this one. They will have to accept ANY DBMS validation syntax - or lack of syntax in the case of Filemaker, which let you enter a validation range in two boxes - no syntax required. I would love to see an offering that the examiners could definitely say is incorrect, since students were not instructed to nominate the DBMS for which the validation rule applies! </p>
<p class="myanswer"><span class="red">State average was 0.85 / 2 (43%)</span></p>
<p class="examiner">Most students could recommend a data type for the ProductID field but fewer could successfully justify their choice. The following are examples of successful responses.<br />
Autonumber because it provides a unique and sequential ID number automatically.<br />
Text because it can be made unique and many companies like to include meaningful text in the ID.<br />
Number because it can be easily made unique.</p>
<p>The following error message is displayed when 31.00 is entered in the Unit Price field. 'The Unit Price must be between and including $10 and $25'</p>

<p class="examiner">Few students could write the rule for the message using the symbols.</p>
<p class="myanswer">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">c. Explain the role of the error message in enhancing the quality of the information. (2 marks, 3 lines)</p>
<p class="myanswer">The role of the error message is to alert the data entry operator to the entry of unreasonable data. Once the unreasonable data is removed, the resultant information will be more accurate and valuable.</p>
<p class="myanswer"><span class="red">State average was 1.05 / 2 (53%)</span></p>
<p class="examiner">Successful responses to this question identified the two components of an error message as &lsquo;telling users in plain language that they have made a mistake&rsquo; and &lsquo;explaining how to fix it.&rsquo; Most students could identify one of these components of the role an effective error message plays in an information system.</p>

<p>Sue has created a one-to-many relationship between the CategorylD fields in these tables.</p>
<p>d. i. Define a one-to-many relationship. (2 marks, 4 lines. Interestingly, the mark allocation for parts i and ii is not given in several questions)</p>
<p class="myanswer">A one-to-many relationship is where a key field in one table can match more than one record in a related table. </p>
<p>ii. Explain one advantage of this one-to-many relationship.</p>
<p class="myanswer">It allows Sue to easily find all albums in a given category.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Oh dear. I was hoping the examiners could do better than a &quot;Define this term&quot; type question. They're way low down in Bloom's taxonomy and encourage students to <strong>memorise</strong> rather than <strong>understand</strong>. In future, please avoid them, guys!</p>
<p class="myanswer"><span class="red">State average was 0.4 / 2 (20%)</span></p>
<p class="examiner">Few students could clearly state that in a one-to-many relationship, one record in the first table is related to many records in the second table or give an example such as &lsquo;one record in the Category table is related to many records in the Product table.&rsquo;<br />
Even fewer students could explain that the one-to-many relationship means there is no need to duplicate data entry in the second table or that it makes queries about products in a particular category easier because the tables are linked. Some students confused the ideas associated with records, fields and tables. This is disappointing, as the concept of a one-to-many relationship is a fundamental underpinning of a reliable database management system.</p>

<p class="myanswer">But what's this? Task 5, the milestone has no predecessor, so it strictly speaking should happen on the first Monday! We have to assume that it comes after task 4 because it appears after it in the task list. And since the tasks have no real identities, we can't logically assume that this task follows that one. Not good. Bad, bad examiner!</p>

<p><span class="red">State average was 2 / 5 (40%)</span></p>
<p class="examiner">Many students were able to shade in the tasks on the calendar correctly but most were unable to obtain full marks because they could not correctly place a Milestone symbol and the Predecessor arrows.</p>
<p>b. Explain the purpose of the milestone (1 mark, 2 lines)</p>
<p class="myanswer">The milestone shows an event (of zero duration) rather than a task (which requires something to be done by someone). Milestones show progress points to let project managers see if the project is on schedule or not.</p>
<p class="myanswer"><span class="red">State average was 0.45 / 1 (45%)</span></p>
<p class="examiner">Only 43 per cent of students correctly defined the function of a milestone as, for example, &lsquo;the date when a group of tasks is completed&rsquo; or &lsquo;the end of a significant point in the project&rsquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Question 8</strong> - 3 marks</p>
<p>Stefano runs an online book selling business. To increase his business, Stefano wants to introduce a 10% discount for new customers paying by credit card. He designs a macro so that when an order is processed, new customers get a 10% discount.<br />
Place the number corresponding to the correct action in the appropriate position in the flowchart shown below.</p>

<p class="examiner">A majority of students placed the correct action in the sections of the flow chart that did not involve the decision box and yes and no branches. Many students did not recognise the statement &lsquo;Is this an existing customer?&rsquo; as the reverse of the statement that Stefano wanted to &lsquo;introduce a 10% discount for new customers&rsquo; and placed the yes and no actions on the wrong branches.</p>

<p><strong>Question 9</strong> (2 marks)</p>
<p>Geography teachers at Seaside Secondary College have created a prototype website that will allow Year 10 students to access class notes, project instructions and local maps. Students will be able to upload data to the website to assist with the preparation of their projects. It is proposed that teams of students be allocated Internet-enabled mobile phones, with high resolution cameras, for their first project.</p>
<p>a. i. Name the type of network these teams are using.</p>
<p><img src="/m/schmacho.jpg" width="98" height="150" /></p>
<p class="myanswer">Hmmm. Let's see why the doggies will love this breakfast. The question is ambiguous: &quot;type&quot; of network could refer to :</p>
<ul>
<li class="myanswer">LAN/WAN - the mobile phones suggest it's becoming a WAN, but how far from the network are they? If they are close, it's a LAN. If distant, could be a WAN.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Client-Server / Peer-to-Peer</li>
<li class="myanswer">Ethernet</li>
<li class="myanswer">and probably other networking categories I've never heard of.</li>
</ul>
<p class="myanswer">Student who stated any of these should get a mark. This type of poor question has floated around before. The examiners should have been more careful. </p>
<p class="examiner">9ai. <br />
Only a minority of students identified the network described as a WAN.</p>
<p class="myanswer"><strong>PROBABLY BECAUSE THE QUESTION WAS VERY BADLY WRITTEN! <br />
DON'T BLAME THE POOR STUDENTS FOR YOUR OWN AMBIGUOUS QUESTIONS!</strong></p>
<p>ii. Describe one advantage of this type of network for the students studying geography.</p>
<p class="myanswer">They could access network documents and upload new documents from remote locations while on site.</p>
<p class="myanswer"><span class="red">State average was 0.55 / 1 (55%)</span></p>
<p class="examiner">9aii.<br />
Few students could explain that as the Internet-enabled mobile phones provided students with access to the prototype website, they would be able get their class notes while on geography excursions. Successful responses gave examples that included accessing online information about geography and maps.</p>
<p>b. Identify a potential problem for the school when these teams transmit data to the website.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Data could be coming from unauthorised people (?)</p>
<p class="myanswer">Incoming data could contain malicious content (e.g. trojans) (?) </p>
<p class="myanswer">Not easy to come up with something convincing.</p>
<p class="myanswer"><span class="red">State average was 0.65 / 1 (65%)</span></p>
<p class="examiner">Most students identified a potential problem if teams sent data directly to the website. Examples included &lsquo;inappropriate images or sent text directly to website which embarrass the school&rsquo;, &lsquo;outsiders intercepting data or sending data to embarrass the school&rsquo;, &lsquo;the school would need a teacher to check content or anti virus software or spyware&rsquo;.<br />
Other successful responses focused on technical problems and these included &lsquo;upload time, disk space, limited bandwidth and mobile drop out time&rsquo;.</p>
<p>c. The geography teachers have been asked to evaluate the effectiveness of this prototype website. (2 marks)</p>
<p>i. Recommend one criterion which could be used for this evaluation. (1 line)</p>
<ul>
<li class="myanswer">Accuracy of data uploaded/downloaded.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Ease of use of the system.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Readability.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Accessibility for people with disabilities.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Security of the site.</li>
</ul>
<p class="myanswer">Remember that the question asks for <strong>effectiveness</strong> of the site, rather than its efficiency.</p>
<p>ii. Explain why you chose this criterion. (2 lines)</p>
<ul>
<li class="myanswer">Accuracy of data uploaded/downloaded - if data are inaccurate, any further processing would be a waste of time.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Ease of use of the site - if it's hard to use, people will be unwilling to use it, or will work inefficiently</li>
<li class="myanswer">Readability - anything that is hard to read could lead to errors or annoyance.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Accessibility for people with disabilities - students could well have vision/mobility or other special needs</li>
<li class="myanswer">Security of the site - if it were compromised, it could be damaged and valuable data lost or damaged. </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="red">State average was 0.55 / 2</span> <span class="red"> (28%)</span></p>
<p class="examiner">This question asked students to provide one criterion to measure the effectiveness of the school website and most correct responses posed questions in terms of accessibility, usability, accuracy or timeliness. Typical examples included:<br />
&bull; will students have easier access to their class notes?<br />
&bull; will students be able to use the site to find the maps they want easily <strong>or quickly</strong>? <span class="comment">(my emphasis - see below)</span><br />
&bull; will students be able to intuitively find accurate information when they need it on excursions?<br />
Responses that only referred to time or effort without a reference to a measure of effectiveness did not score any marks.</p>
<p class="examiner"><span class="comment">In the second dotpoint, the examiners have it wrong. &quot;Quickly&quot; relates to efficiency rather than effectiveness.</span></p>
<p class="examiner">9cii.<br />
The successful explanations for choosing criteria typically stated &lsquo;if the prototype website does not give easier access to class notes then it is not successful&rsquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Question 10</strong> - 5 marks</p>
<p>ToysOnline advertise and sell toys online. Two screen mock-ups for a new home page are shown below.</p>
<p><img src="/m/pm/08i-b10.jpg" width="501" height="212" /></p>
<p>The owner of ToysOnline does not like either screen mock-up.</p>
<p>a. Hand draw a new design that is complete and appropriate for the content. Indicate fonts, colours, links and layout. (5 marks, 3/4 page empty box)</p>
<p class="myanswer">It's interesting that the exam sets such a large job. In the past, questions have been rarely worth more than 3 marks. Some of my McKinnon students were taken aback because I'd told them during the year that it would be unlikely that the exam would entail a complete task (e.g. an entire Gantt/PERT chart, flowchart). Anyway, it's actually good to see a more challenging task that requires kids to plan and think.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Students should have included:</p>
<ul>
<li class="myanswer"> All of the links from the first mockup</li>
<li class="myanswer">All or most of the images in the second mockup</li>
<li class="myanswer">The images should accompany the corresponding text link</li>
<li class="myanswer">Font information e.g. small serif, fancy, large font (perhaps more specifically, e.g. &quot;Addled&quot; typeface, 20 point, italic, bold&quot;). Remember that <strong>typeface</strong> refers to Arial, Times New Roman etc. <strong>Font</strong> is a complete set of type characteristics - typeface <strong>plus</strong> size <strong>plus </strong>styling (e.g. italic, bold)</li>
<li class="myanswer">Colours should show good choices about contrast (especially text/background colours)</li>
<li class="myanswer">Links might show the actual page name that would be linked to</li>
<li class="myanswer">Layout will demonstrate good hierarchical decisions (important things are big and at the top, less important things are smaller and appear later). There should be good whitespace. Page components should be attractively aligned.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Good students would have added links to: contacts; privacy policy; about us. </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="red">State average was 4.05 / 5</span> <span class="red"> (81%)</span> <span class="comment">- a surprisingly good result by the cohort!</span></p>
<p class="examiner">It was very pleasing to see that the majority of students received full marks for their hand drawn and annotated design of a new website for ToysOnline.</p>

</table>
<p align="left">b. Choose two design elements from the list shown and explain how each has been considered in your design. (4 marks)</p>
<p class="myanswer">Answering this depends on the student's design. They should be able to show deliberate use of features that help accomplish two of the design elements.</p>
<p class="myanswer">e.g.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Colour and Contrast - I used black or dark blue text on a white background to ensure the text was easily readable.</p>
<p class="myanswer"><span class="red">State average was 2.8 / 4</span> <span class="red"> (70%)</span></p>
<p class="examiner">Students who could explain how they had used two design elements with specific reference to their design and annotations received full marks for the second part of the question.<br />
Many students correctly explained how two design elements are considered in a website in general terms but lost marks because they did not use their own design for the ToysOnline website or their own annotations to illustrate their explanation.</p>

<strong>Question 11</strong></p>
<p align="left"><br />
A group of thirteen professional sports coaches, located all over Australia, communicate as a virtual team. They discuss rule changes and umpiring decisions collaboratively. They use the Internet and Acme Office 2004 for their communications.</p>
<p align="left" class="myanswer">'Acme Office' - hehehehe</p>
<p align="left"> a. Describe how the coaches could use the Internet to make group decisions. (2)</p>
<p align="left" class="myanswer">They can use a Wiki to gather and share information. <br />
They can use videoconferencing to mimic face-to-face meetings. <br />
They can use survey software to do polls and voting. <br />
They can discuss issues over email, online chat, mailing lists. <br />
They can use VoIP to get cheap real-time phone calls.</p>
<p align="left" class="myanswer"><span class="red">State average was 1.35 / 2</span> <span class="red"> (68%)</span></p>
<p align="left" class="red">It was clear that most students understood the concepts associated with the agreements and security issues associated with setting up and participating in a virtual private network (VPN). Successful responses included a variety of examples directly related to the activities of the sports coaches.</p>
<p align="left" class="red">11a. Students who described both a network feature and the type of collaboration it supported were awarded full marks for their response. Common examples were &lsquo;coaches can use email to share files about game tactics&rsquo; and &lsquo;coaches use electronic polling about decisions or new rules&rsquo;.</p>
<p>b. Discuss how the coaches can avoid journalists gaining access to their discussions before any decisions are released officially. Give an example to support your answer. (2)</p>
<ul>
<li class="myanswer">A Virtual Private Network could provide an encrypted channel across the internet for private discussions. </li>
<li class="myanswer"> They could also use encryption (e.g. PGP) on transmitted documents to make them unreadable to unauthorised people. </li>
<li class="myanswer">Putting password protection on Office documents will protect them. </li>
<li class="myanswer">Requiring a username and password to enter their website would protect their site.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Using firewalls on team members' computers will guard against hacking.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Using virus scanners on team members' computers will guard against infestation by trojans which could steal information. </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="red">State average was 1.3 / 2</span><span class="red"> (65%)</span></p>
<p class="examiner">Examples provided included &lsquo;secure login or encryption or headcount procedures for a network meeting, Wiki or MSN Messenger&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Two coaches recently installed the latest Acme Office 2008 suite on their computers. The other eleven coaches complain that now they cannot open attached files from these two coaches.</p>
<p>c. Explain why this problem has occurred. (1)</p>
<p class="myanswer">Acme Office 2008, invented by maniacal mogul Gil Bates, adopted a new XML based file format which
is not compatible with previous document file formats, which royally annoys the hell out of people living in Acmeland.</p>
<p class="myanswer"><span class="red">State average was 0.7 / 1</span> <span class="red"> (70%)</span></p>
<p class="examiner">Most students identified the problem of an old version of software not being compatible with a new version. This was typically described as &lsquo;not backward compatible&rsquo; or &lsquo;they have different file extensions&rsquo;.</p>
<p align="left">d. Recommend a strategy to stop this type of problem. Justify your answer. (2)</p>
<p align="left" class="myanswer">Either upgrade all team members to the same vile version of Acme Office, or require all 2008 users to save their documents back to the previous 2004 format. Or give up on Gil Bates, and replace Acme Windows with Acme Linux and use Acme Open Office.</p>
<p align="left" class="myanswer"><span class="red">State average was 1.15 / 2</span> <span class="red"> (58%)</span></p>
<p align="left" class="red">Most students described and justified a strategy that included a procedure for agreement between coaches or a technical solution for the incompatible files. Strategies that justified the need for both were awarded full marks.</p>

<p class="myanswer">And if the markers penalise students for using named ranges in their answer, I hope their hubcaps fall off.</p>
<p class="myanswer"><span class="red">State average was 0.05 / 1</span> <span class="red"> (5%)</span>- a terrible result. The question was fair, but obviously students really SUCK with formulae. Teachers will really need to push basic Excel skills.</p>
<p class="examiner">Very few students could correctly write the formula for the VLOOKUP statement<br />
=VLOOKUP(C2,$G$9:$H$11,2)*C2<br />
or<br />
=VLOOKUP(C2, G$9:H$11,2)*C2<br />
A small number of students wrote formulas made up of nested loops. These responses were awarded marks where the formula worked correctly.</p>
<p class="myanswer"><strong>&quot;Nested loops&quot;?? Do the examiners mean nested IFs??</strong> <strong>O dear...</strong></p>
<p>The spreadsheet designer has been asked by AutoFresh managers to provide a formula that returns the highest sales of all the types each month in cell C15.</p>

<p class="myanswer"><span class="red">State average was 0.3 / 1</span> <span class="red"> (30%)</span></p>
<p class="examiner">Successful responses to this question provided test data that would trigger a change to the existing maximum number in cell C6, which was 37.<br />
The most frequent successful response was C3 = 38 and C15 = 38<br />
Students who gave responses such as C&gt; 38 and C3= C15 were also awarded marks.</p>
<p>e. Suggest how the spreadsheet could be altered to enhance the meaning of the information shown in C15. (1)</p>
<p class="myanswer">Change the label in A15 to &quot;Maximum sale quantity&quot;?</p>
<p class="myanswer">To be a tricky little devil, you could go further (as, in fact, I think the examiners were fishing for). For example, replace A15 with this modest formula...</p>
<p class="myanswer">=&quot;The biggest sales were for &quot; &amp; INDEX(A2:C12,MATCH(MAX(C2:C12),C2:C12,0),1) &amp; &quot; which sold &quot; &amp; MAX(C2:C12) </p>
<p class="myanswer">This would display (for example) &quot;The biggest sales were for Cappuccino which sold 38.&quot; Pretty basic, I know, but I can't think of anything else. <a href="/m/pm/08i-12e.xls">Download a sample spreadsheet (Acme Excel 2003) if you're curious about INDEX and MATCH.</a></p>
<p class="myanswer"><span class="red">State average was 0.4 / 1</span> <span class="red"> (40%)</span></p>
<p class="examiner">The successful responses to this question suggested ways to make the spreadsheet more user-friendly. Examples included &lsquo;add a label to the A15 cell&rsquo;, &lsquo;add a macro or coding or a program that highlights the name of the maximum sale &ndash; cappuccino&rsquo; and &lsquo;insert a new column to highlight the name of the maximum sale &ndash; cappuccino&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The AutoFresh managers currently receive reports containing pie graphs/charts of sales figures at the end of each month. AutoFresh managers want to print pie graphs or charts of the Sales at other times in the month.</p>
<p>The Help Desk creates a macro to complete this task.</p>
<p> f. 2 marks</p>
<p>i. Explain why the Help Desk chose a macro.</p>
<p class="myanswer">A macro makes a complex task simple. It is especially useful for unskilled operators, or for functions that are rarely carried out and easily forgotten. Even for skilled operators, macros are often faster than performing tasks manually.</p>
<p>ii. Describe how this helps to meet the managers' information needs.</p>
<p class="myanswer">It provides the information in an easily-interpreted format and in a timely fashion.</p>
<p ><span class="red">State average was 0.75 / 2</span> <span class="red"> (38%)</span></p>
<p ><span class="red">Most students understood, in general terms, the reason for choosing a macro to solve the manager&rsquo;s information problems.</span></p>
<p ><span class="red">12fi.<br />
Successful explanations of why the Help Desk chose the macro included &lsquo;a macro is more user friendly for the managers because it correctly selects the range and sequence of steps&rsquo; or &lsquo;the Help Desk gets less calls because managers make less mistakes&rsquo;.</span></p>
<p ><span class="red">12fii.<br />
Successful descriptions of how the macro saves the managers time included &lsquo;stops time being wasted on slips or preventable errors&rsquo;, &lsquo;managers can rely on the information to make important decisions because the macro is foolproof&rsquo; and &lsquo;it saves the managers time because they can click one button and the whole chart process is done for them&rsquo;.</span></p>
