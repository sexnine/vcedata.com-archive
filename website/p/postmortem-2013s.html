<p> A software project has been completed and the software solution has been running successfully for a few months. Simon is collecting all the documentation that was created during the project. In one of the documents he notices this statement: 'When executed, the program must occupy no more than 10 MB of main memory.'<br />
 During which stage of the problem-solving methodology was this statement most probably written?<br />
 <strong>A.</strong> design<br />
 <strong>B.</strong> analysis<br />
 <strong>C.</strong> evaluation<br />
 <strong>D.</strong> development</p>
<p class="myanswer">Answer is B. It's a (non-functional) solution requirement, and these are determined during analysis.</p>
<p class="comment">Note: I've been asked whether it might be an evaluation criterion, which would be determined during design. If it were, it would be evaluated over time after implementation (as reliability or profitability would be), which does not seem to fit in this case. The question stresses that the statement was <strong>found</strong> after implementation, but that does not mean it was <strong>written</strong> about evaluation - it could easily have been written during analysis or design.</p>
<p class="comment">A wise teacher, has suggested that the statement is a <strong>technical constraint</strong> and not a solution requirement nor an evaluation criterion, which sounds right to me. Peter deserves a virtual Schmacko. <br />
 In either case, the answer to A2 is still B.</p>
<p class="comment">Interesting question: how do you tell the difference between a solution's non-functional requirement (e.g. 'it must be easy to use') and a solution's evaluation criterion (e.g. 'it must be easy to use') ?</p>
<p class="comment">Could the statement have been written during either analysis <strong>or</strong> design, for different reasons?</p>

<p> Frank rings his computer-repair person. He explains, 'I'd just finished using a new application program that I downloaded from the internet and my computer suddenly went crazy. I shut my computer down and, when I restarted it, I noticed that all my photos had been deleted'.<br />
 Based on his explanation, Frank has most likely fallen victim to<br />
 <strong>A.</strong> spyware.<br />
 <strong>B.</strong> a Trojan.<br />
 <strong>C.</strong> a hard-disk failure.<br />
 <strong>D.</strong> poor programming.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Answer is B. A Trojan is malicious software which could likely damage files, amongst other undesirable actions.<br />
 Spyware monitors a user's actions but is not designed to do damage. <br />
 A hard disk failure would not selectively delete files of one type (photos, for example).<br />
 Poor programming might cause a crash, but is unlikely to also happen to also delete every file of one type. </p>

 <strong>B.</strong> a queue.<br />
 <strong>C.</strong> an integer.<br />
 <strong>D.</strong> a 2-D array.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Answer is A. A stack returns values in the reverse order in which they were entered. (First in last out).<br />
 A queue would return values in the same order in which they were entered (First in first out - a special form of stack). <br />
 An integer is a data type, not a data structure.<br />
 It can't be a 2-D array because it's obviously only one-dimensional. </p>

 'A system that uses internet protocols to allow the sharing of information across an organisation's local area network.

<p class="myanswer">Answer is D.</p>
<p class="myanswer">This is a cunning question. I like it. Many smartypants out there might have seen (B) and gone &quot;Bingo!&quot; and leapt to the next question, thinking &quot;What's this &quot;6.28&quot; rot going on in the other options?&quot;</p>
<p class="myanswer">While all of the options would work, the best answer comes down to <strong>efficiency</strong>.</p>
<p class="myanswer">(A) is the least efficient since it contains an invariant statement - it repetitively assigns the same value to myPi on every loop even though the value never needs to change.<br />
 (B) is better, because it moves the invariant statement
 outside the loop so it is evaluated only once for the entire run of the program.<br />
 But if you look closely, there is yet another invariant statement - 2 * myPi in (A) and (B). That could be removed from the loop as well, saving one more unnecessary operation.<br />
 (C) shares the same efficiency problem as (A), so exclude that.<br />
 That leaves (D) - the most efficient (but slightly harder to read) alternative. <br />
</p>
<p class="myanswer">This dilemma between choosing tight code or readability has been with programmers for years. One strategy is to use simpler, verbose code while debugging, then <strong>optimise</strong> the code after it's working. The C family has often been criticised for the impenetrable nature of its code when its really tightly optimised.</p>

<td ><p><strong>Question 9</strong></p>
<p>Fast Ethernet is a local area networking technology. One of the standards it is based on is known as 100BASE-T, which specifies a 100 megabits per second transmission rate using multi-level signal encoding over a twisted pair cable.<br />
 From this description, which layer of the Open Systems Interconnections (OSI) model does 100BASE-T deal with?<br />
 <strong>A.</strong> the	network layer<br />
 <strong>B.</strong> the	data link layer<br />
 <strong>C.</strong> the	physical layer<br />
 <strong>D.</strong> the	transport layer</p>
<p class="myanswer">Answer is C. The study design says that the physical layer is really the only one you need to know, so the examiners will be unlikely to present a really specific question on any other OSI layer.</p>

 Pseudocode is not used during analysis (A). <br />
 It <strong>is</strong> used to solve problems in program logic. (B)<br />
 It <strong>would</strong> be occasionally used during the development of a new programming language (C), but that case would be pretty rare compared to the its use during the development of other programs.<br />
 It is definitely <strong>not</strong> the same as coding in a specific language.
 (D). Pseudocode is meant to be a universal, language-independent tool for logic design. It does use common constructs like LOOP, ENDWHILE, READ etc - but these are concepts used in all languages, although their names will vary.</p>

<td valign="top"><p><strong>Question 3 (4 marks)</strong></p>
<p> A software development company has just completed a software solution for the plumbing faculty of a college. The software will randomly generate sets of multiple-choice questions that will test students on various parts of a plumbing course. The software will be able to assess the test and provide immediate results to the students and their teachers.</p>
<p><strong>a.</strong> What is acceptance testing and who should be involved in the acceptance testing of this software solution? 2 marks [6 lines]</p>
<p class="myanswer">Acceptance testing is when the client (or an end-user*) uses the software to determine if it meets the needs that were determined during system analysis, and to determine whether they should accept the software.<br />
 The dean of the plumbing faculty (or a plumbing teacher or plumbing student*) would be involved.</p>
<p class="comment">*There are different interpretations of &quot;acceptance testing&quot; and &quot;user acceptance testing&quot;. Some people treat them synonymously; others use &quot;acceptance testing&quot; to refer to testing by the client (e.g. plumbing faculty manager), and UAT to refer to testing by a typical end-user (e.g. a plumbing student) to get a real user's perspective. </p>
<p class="comment">The study design (SD U4O2 KK07 - page 47) itself includes key knowledge of &quot;criteria and techniques for <strong>testing acceptance by users</strong> of solutions&quot; ; in fact the design ONLY refers to &quot;acceptance by users.&quot; This actually strongly implies that the question is about UAT (acceptance by typical users) rather than acceptance by the purchaser of the software (e.g. the plumbing faculty's boss.)</p>
<p class="comment">I hope the markers are aware of this greyness of definitions. The Real World&#8482; stubbornly resists the neat categorisations that VCAA loves so much. I will be on my Very High Horse if the examiner's report does not accept UAT.</p>
<p class="examiner">Average mark: 1.0/4 (25%)</p>
<p class="examiner">Acceptance testing is conducted during development to determine if the solution requirements (functional and non-functional) as specified in the software requirements specification (SRS) have been met. It is usually conducted by members of the organisation who commissioned the solution.<br />
 In a question of this type it is important that students identify the two parts of the question, first the &lsquo;what&rsquo; and then the &lsquo;who&rsquo;; both needed to be addressed to gain the two marks for the question. Many students did not answer both parts of this question. Students are encouraged to clearly show their knowledge, which can be done by answering each part as a separate statement; for example, by defining acceptance testing in detail then describing who in this scenario would be involved in testing the solution.</p>
<p class="examiner">The following is an example of a high-scoring response.</p>
<blockquote>
 <p class="examiner">  Acceptance testing is where you get the client/users of the software solution to use the software developed and make sure it fulfils all their needs and the requirements specified in the SRS. In this case the students and teachers from the plumbing faculty college would be involved in the testing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>b.</strong> Suggest <strong>two</strong> specific evaluation criteria to measure the effectiveness of this solution for the plumbing faculty. 2 marks [6 lines]</p>
<ul>
 <li class="myanswer">accuracy of assessments</li>
 <li class="myanswer">the degree of randomness of the questions.</li>
 <li class="myanswer">readability of the questions.</li>
 <li class="myanswer">accessibility for students with disabilities.</li>
 <li class="myanswer">usability</li>
</ul>
<p class="myanswer">Note: I orignally included 'speed' since the case study did stress &quot;immediate results&quot;, but then re-read the question and remembered the &quot;effectiveness&quot; criterion! 'Ease of use' is also (according to VCAA) an effectiveness measure.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Teacher Peter has pointed out that &quot;timeliness&quot; might suit here, since it's listed in the glossary as an effectiveness measure. The dividing line between efficiency's &quot;speed&quot; and effectiveness' &quot;timeliness&quot; is a difficult and grey area, I'd say. Speed is very closely bound to timeliness... A very messy can of worms!</p>
<p class="myanswer">One must assume the criteria I suggested are reasonable even though the case study does not suggest any other constraints. One should avoid unrealistic speculation that is not supported by the given facts, such as &quot;resistance to nuclear attack.&quot;</p>
<p class="comment">The software would not &quot;assess the test&quot; - this would mean determining if the test were good or not. It would assess the <strong>student's answers</strong>.</p>
<p class="examiner">Average mark: 1.2/2 (60%)</p>
<p class="examiner">Measures of an effective solution include completeness, readability, attractiveness, clarity, accuracy, accessibility, timeliness, communication of message, relevance and usability.<br />
 Evaluation criteria are developed during design and reflect the solution requirements. This question required students to suggest appropriate effectiveness criteria; however, many students missed this keyword. Effectiveness and efficiency are keywords defined in the study design glossary and students should be able to apply them as appropriate throughout their responses.<br />
 Some student examples of possible evaluation criteria are listed below, in a number of formats; questions, statements and identification of measure. All of these were acceptable.</p>
<blockquote>
 <p class="examiner"> Does the software solution provide 100% accurate test results to the students and teachers?<br />
  Does the software solution provide test results in a form that is relevant and complete?<br />
  Is the user interface easy to understand?<br />
  Is the solution clear and well explained?<br />
  Does it use the correct plumbing language?<br />
  Results of the test are given accurately after the completion of the test.<br />
  Accuracy &ndash; the solution&rsquo;s results must be correct i.e. returning the correct number of marks that each student received.<br />
  Completeness &ndash; the information that is returned to the students and teachers should be able to return all information i.e. their mark, which ones were incorrect etc.</p>

 <p align="left">CASE STUDY INSERT FOR SECTION C<br />
 Please remove from the centre of this book during reading time. </p>
 <p><strong>Case study</strong><br />
 </p>
 <p>An organisation called the Protection of National Parks and Wildlife (PNPW) is responsible for monitoring the health of native animals and controlling wild animals across all national parks in Victoria. Currently this is achieved in three ways</p>
 <ul>
 <li>a network of animal-monitoring stations located in the national parks, where park rangers monitor animal activity on a weekly basis</li>
 <li>the use of aircraft to actively locate animals using heat-detection cameras in the very remote areas</li>
 <li>
 <div align="left">reports from staff who work in the parks, the general public and other emergency service organisations</div>
 </li>
 </ul>
 <p align="left">As a result of recent budget cuts, PNPW needs to find ways to reduce its costs. The animal-monitoring stations are important and relatively inexpensive to run. However, the use of aircraft requires the hiring of several aircraft and pilots every week.</p>
 <p align="left"> Brenda Benbow, the manager of PNPW, has been working on a plan for using a drone (an unmanned aircraft) to monitor the native animals. This will cut down on the annual cost associated with the hiring of aircraft and pilots.</p>
 <p align="left"><img src="/m/pm/13s-cs1.gif" width="331" height="236" alt="drone" /><br />
 </p>
 <p align="left">She has chosen a model that can pilot itself once it has been given simple instructions. This model is fitted with a standard micro-video camera, an infra-red camera and global positioning system (GPS) technology. It also has two communication channels: a standard wireless network interface card and a radio transmitter/receiver. The radio has a range of about 50 km.</p>
 <p align="left"> Each drone will be placed at a rural airfield. When a drone has to make a flight, it will be sent flight instructions from PNPW headquarters in Melbourne via a PNPW officer's notebook computer. The PNPW officer will then launch the drone from a car at the airfield.</p>
 <h3 align="center"><img src="/m/pm/13s-cs2.gif" width="600" height="166" alt="data transfer" /></h3>
 <p align="left">Once airborne, the drone will fly its preset patrol path. It can detect hotspots as small as 20 cm in diameter. This means that it can 'see' most wildlife. On detection of a hotspot, the drone will interrupt its preset patrol path, start monitoring the hotspot and pass control to a tablet computer at the nearest monitoring station. The drone will also transmit what it is 'seeing' to the tablet computer. The tablet will use wi-fi to communicate with the drone through the monitoring 
 station's wi-fi router. The router uses the national park's communication system to communicate with the drone. The park rangers who are monitoring animals will then decide whether or not the picture shows an animal that requires further monitoring.</p>
 <p align="left"><img src="/m/pm/13s-cs3.gif" width="700" height="442" alt="communications" /></p>
 <p align="left">Brenda has hired Drone Solutions to develop the software for the new Aerial Animal-Detection System (AADS). She has provided the company with details of the drone operation, the hardware resources contained on the drone and the requirements of the software operation. Software will have to be written for the computer at PNPW headquarters, the drone and the tablet computers to be used by the park rangers.</p>

  It was encouraging to see that students were able to identify that this question asked for tasks that occurred during the analysis stage of the problem-solving methodology. It was important to note that the question required a task. This meant that an action word (for example, create, interview, determine, write, etc.) needed to be provided within the response.<br />
  The following are examples of appropriate student responses.</p>
 <blockquote>
  <p align="left" class="examiner">  Prepare a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) which will be used in the later stages of the project.<br />
   Collect data that would assist in the creation of the AADS, which could range from interviewing rangers to researching similar systems.<br />
   Determine the solution requirements. This includes the functional requirements of the AADS (what it must do to meet the goals of the solution) and the non-functional requirements (the qualities of the AADS).<br />
   Determine the scope of the solution. This sets the boundaries as to exactly what AADS will do and equally as important, what it won&rsquo;t do.</p>

 <p class="myanswer">It's much easier if you remember that the DFD is actually just details of processes <strong>within</strong> the Context diagram's circle.

  Students should have noted the requirement to justify their response, and that four marks had been allocated. In general, a response that provided the correct choice, provided a justification for a queue data structure or stack structure and correctly applied the response to the case study obtained full marks.<br />
  The following are examples of high-scoring student responses.</p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="examiner">  Choice: queue<br />
   Justification: As the first coordinates entered will the first points the drone flies to, queue would be the most appropriate data structure, as it goes by the rules &lsquo;first in first out&rsquo; as compared to a stack which goes by the rule &lsquo;last in first out&rsquo; which would not be appropriate as this would cause the last coordinate being entered to be the first point the drone flies to.<br />
   Choice: queue<br />
   Justification: Since the queues have a &lsquo;first in first out&rsquo; nature, this would satisfy the &lsquo;first coordinates entered being the first point the drone flies to&rsquo; statement. Melanie&rsquo;s choice would be incorrect as a stack follows the &lsquo;first in, last out&rsquo; principle, which would not satisfy the required method stated.</p>

This can prevent breaches of the rules due to honest ignorance of them, e.g. by newcomers. It also lets the group leaders sanction rule breakers since they had no excuse for misbehaving.</p>
 <p class="myanswer">A code of ethics also serves to uphold the public reputation of a group. It also bonds its members in a comraderie born of shared ideals.</p>
 <p class="examiner">Average mark: 1.3/3 (43%)</p>
 <p class="examiner">In general, students were able to give some information about the purpose of a code of ethics; however, many found it difficult to expand their response to provide adequate detail and depth for full marks.<br />
  The following is a possible response.</p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="examiner">  A code of ethics outlines values and principles that should be upheld by stakeholders. A code states what is acceptable behaviour and can provide guidelines for resolving ethical dilemmas. They are not laws but rather values that help professionals make decisions about going about their work.</p>

  <li class="myanswer">Seek permission to use the software from its author/owner.</li>

 </ul>
 <p class="comment">Once again (they did it in the <a href="/p/postmortem-2013i.htm#b8">2013 ITA paper, B8c</a>) the examiners have just assumed there <strong>is</strong> an ethical dilemma with no due explanation. The case study did not say whether the software was commercial, freeware, Open Source, GNU licensed or whatever. Did Melanie even ask the status of the software?<br />
  If the software were commercial, it would be a copyright issue, and there would be no ethical dilemma because his use of it would be a legal matter, not an ethical one.<br />
  If there <strong>is</strong> an ethical dilemma in the situation, why not give enough information for the students to determine what the dilemma is? Then ask them to say what it is, and then ask how to resolve it.</p>
 <p class="comment">Not a good question.</p>

 <p class="examiner">Average mark: 0.5/2 (25%)</p>
 <p class="examiner">Students needed to discuss using the code of ethics and/or decision support frameworks to help resolve the ethical dilemma.<br />
  Many students found it difficult to identify the ethical dilemma of whether George should use the code; instead they concentrated on the illegal downloading of the code. Many responses incorrectly stated &lsquo;just stop using the code&rsquo; as the way he could resolve the dilemma. Students are reminded that answers should apply to the case study.<br />
  The following is an example of a high-scoring student response.</p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="examiner">  His ethical dilemma is that if he uses the software off the internet without permission, he could be in breach of the Copyright Act 1968, but by using the software it will make the development process of the software be much quicker (more efficiency). To resolve the ethical dilemma, George must consult the company&rsquo;s code of ethics and decision support framework to see what the best method to go about creating the software is, and to see what company policy says about using other people intellectual property.</p>

 <p class="question"> When a drone detects a hotspot (a temperature above 20&deg;C), it immediately interrupts its preset patrol path and begins monitoring the hotspot. This new path will allow the drone to continuously view the hotspot. This is done in a function called StartMonitoring. It will continue to monitor for five minutes before returning to its patrol path unless told to continue monitoring or to resume its patrol path immediately. This message is received in a variable AlertReply. If told to continue monitoring, it will do so for five minutes or until another AlertReply is sent. When it has finished monitoring, it automatically resumes its patrol path using a function ResumePatrol.<br />

<td valign="top"><p class="question"><strong>Question 11 (6 marks)</strong></p>
 <p class="question"> George talks to Melanie, who points out a major flaw in his password system. The aim is to have one tablet per monitoring station, not one per user, to reduce costs. A file of all usernames and passwords (expected to exceed 1000 over time as staff move between parks) will be on this tablet. Maximum memory will be needed on the tablet to display the high-resolution video, so Melanie suggests that the file is searched each time a user logs in instead of reading the whole file into memory. She suggests that the file be a random access file, and that the username and password are located using a binary search.<br />
 </p>
 <p class="question">a.	To allow a successful binary search on username to occur, describe what must be done with the records in the file before the search begins. 1 mark [3 lines]</p>
 <p class="myanswer">They must be sorted by username.</p>
 <p class="examiner">Average mark: 0.2/1 (20%)</p>
 <p><span class="examiner">The data in an array needs to be sorted on the username field.<br />
  Students are encouraged to make use of past examination reports as there has been a question on binary searching on the past two examinations. This may have assisted students in avoiding the common mistake of not identifying the data field that needed to be sorted. Many students were aware that for a binary search to occur the data in an array needed to be sorted; however, very few indicated that it needed to be sorted on the username field.</span><br />
 </p>
 <p class="question">b.	Describe the process that the binary search will use to locate the given username. 2 marks [8 lines]</p>
 <p class="question"><span class="myanswer">It will divide the list in half and determine which half the username should be in. <br />
  It discards the other half of the list. <br />
  It repeats the process until only one username remains, or none remain, indicating that the name is not in the list.</span></p>
 <p class="examiner">Average mark: 0.7/2 (35%)</p>
 <p><span class="examiner">The starting point of the search is the midpoint of the file. Half will be disregarded based on the midpoint being higher or lower than the search value. This is then repeated until the value was located.<br />
  Describing a binary search process was quite difficult for most students.<br />
  The following is an example of a high-scoring student response.</span></p>
 <blockquote>
  <p><span class="examiner">  The binary search will compare the username in the middle of the file to username entered. If the entered username is greater then it compares it with the value in the middle of the usernames between the middle of the list and the end of the list. If the entered username is smaller than it will compare it with the username in the middle of the usernames from the start to the middle of the list. This is repeated until the middle value equals the entered username.</span><br />
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p class="question">c.	Explain the difference in the way records are accessed when using a random access file compared to a serial access file and why Melanie has suggested using a random access file. 3 marks [7 lines]</p>
 <p class="myanswer">Since all records in a random file are the same length, the starting byte of any record can be calculated mathematically with <span class="code">(recordnum - 1) * recordlen + 1</span>. Thus, any record can be accessed immediately, skipping any records between the search start point and the record's location.</p>
 <p class="myanswer">Serial files, however, contain records of variable length so any record's starting point cannot be calculated. A search for a record must begin at the start of the file and step sequentially through every record until the desired one is found.</p>
 <p class="myanswer">Thus, random file access can be far faster than serial file access, particularly as file sizes increase, which is what Melanie is anticipating.</p>
 <p class="comment">There <strong>must</strong> be some other questions that VCAA can ask about binary searches and random files... These old chestnuts appear on <strong>every</strong> exam....</p>
 <p class="examiner">Average mark: 1.4/3 (47%)</p>
 <p class="examiner">To gain full marks students were required to describe how records are accessed when using a random access and a serial access file, and why random access files are more appropriate when doing a binary search.<br />
  Many students answered the first two parts of the question but many did not answer the &lsquo;why&rsquo; part. Students are reminded that using the words &lsquo;more efficient&rsquo; is not considered a justification. Students often find it difficult to clearly express the difference between random access and serial access.<br />
  The following is an example of a high-scoring student response.</p>
 <blockquote>
  <p class="examiner">  Random access file allows access to any point in the file, meaning that it does not have to be read in the order it was written (usually indexed). Serial files only allow reading of the contents in the order it was written. Melanie wants to access the file of usernames/passwords for any random person, checking the input of a username and password hence a random access file will be more beneficial as it doesn&rsquo;t have to read in order every time (like a serial file).</p>

<p class="question"> Brenda suggests to George that instead of using tablets to display the data coming from the drone, they should use mobile phones as these are cheaper and everyone has one, so tablets would not have to be purchased.<br />
Explain why the tablet is a better choice. [6 lines]</p>

 <li class="myanswer">Its display is larger and easier to read.</li>
 <li class="myanswer"> It has more space for a bigger battery, therefore having longer life between recharges.<br />

<p class="examiner">The use of a tablet was a better choice as the data being displayed was images with small detail; this was not appropriate on the small screen of a mobile phone.</p>

<p class="question"> When the drone lands, the data files, including video and GPS coordinates, will be downloaded onto a notebook computer. The files will then be deleted from the drone so that there is space for data files from the next flight.</p>
<p class="question"> a.	Is this an example of backup or archiving? Give a reason for your answer.	2	marks [5 lines]</p>
<p class="myanswer">It's archiving. A backup leaves the copied data in place. Archiving moves the data, then deletes the original.</p>
<p class="examiner">Average mark: 1.7/2 (85%)</p>
<p class="examiner">This is an example of archiving, and many students were able to identify that this was characterised by removing the file from the original device.</p>

<td valign="top"><p class="question"><strong>Question 14 (6 marks)</strong></p>
<p class="question"> A major security concern for the software being designed to run on the drone is that hackers (unauthorised users) could take over control of the drone.<br />
 State two measures that could prevent this from happening. Clearly explain how each would prevent unauthorised access to the drone.</p>
<p class="comment">The exam should have bolded the word &quot;two&quot;.</p>
<ul>
 <li class="myanswer">Encrypt all communications between the drone and its operators - this would obfuscate commands and data passing between authorised operators and the drone so that unauthorised users would not be able to read the data or send commands to the drone.</li>
 <li class="myanswer">Require a valid username and password for drone launchers and operators - this would prevent hackers stealing and launching a drone, or using a found/stolen tablet to control the drone.</li>
 <li class="myanswer">Keep inactive drones securely locked away from the public so hackers can't gain access to them and interfere with their operating software.</li>
 <li class="myanswer">Turn off the drone's SSID broadcasting. This would make it a tiny bit harder for hackers to detect the drone's wifi router.</li>
 <li class="myanswer">Make sure the drone's wifi router had a changed admin username and password. This would prevent hackers using default logins to access the drone's router and gaining access to its file system.</li>
 <li class="myanswer">Turn on strong wifi encryption (e.g. WPA2+). This encrypts local wifi communications between the drone's router and nearby people.</li>
 <li class="myanswer">Encrypt the stored source code of the drone's software so it cannot be read by hackers if they managed to find and copy it. This would prevent them finding security vulnerabilities and creating exploits to take advantage of them.</li>
 <li class="comment"><strong>Kill</strong> all of the programmers once the job is done. Bwahahahahaha! <strong>Now</strong> let those hackers try to nail the programmers to a stake and threaten to slice off their ... oops. Sorry. Got a bit &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; there.</li>
 </ul>
<p class="examiner">Average mark: 1.8/6 (30%)</p>
<p class="examiner">This question was poorly answered by most students. Many gave generic security measures, and/or failed to explain the measure or provide details as to how the measure would prevent unauthorised access. Students needed to ensure that the measures they were explaining were appropriate to the device identified in the question (the drone).<br />
 The following is an example of a high-scoring student response.</p>
<blockquote>
 <p class="examiner"> Install a firewall between the tablet and router<br />
  - A firewall controls which user can and cannot have access to certain ports.<br />
  - The firewall would only allow the park rangers access to the drones and would prevent unauthorised outside users.<br />
  </p>
 <p class="examiner">Ensure all path instructions are encrypted<br />
  - Encryption changes the &lsquo;plain text&rsquo; of the flight instructions into unreadable &lsquo;ciphertext&rsquo;.<br />
  - This will ensure that the drones can only accept instructions from the official tablet devices and nothing else.</p>

<p class="question"> Once the software has been accepted by PNPW, all park rangers will be required to use it. The park rangers are very unhappy about this as they have no idea how the new software will work and so they complain to the PNPW management.<br />
 Explain how management could resolve this conflict. [6 lines]</p>
<ul>
 <li class="myanswer">They need to advertise the benefits of the software so rangers will appreciate its importance and be willing to give it a fair go.</li>
 <li class="myanswer">They then need to train rangers how to use the system in a brief and unthreatening way (with nice sandwiches.) Regional training sessions with small groups might be best.</li>
 <li class="myanswer">Training one ranger in each park to become a trainer would provide quick on-site support to other rangers by someone they are familiar and comfortable with.</li>
 <li class="myanswer">They also need to provide plenty of easily accessed documentation to teach or remind rangers how to use the system.</li>
 <li class="myanswer">They need to provide friendly technical support for rangers who are having system faults or trouble using the system.</li>
</ul>
<p class="examiner">Average mark: 1.7/3 (57%)</p>
<p class="examiner">As this question asked students to &lsquo;resolve this conflict&rsquo; it was expected that they would write about decision support frameworks; however, most responses included details of training and/or documentation and were awarded some marks. As some resolution was required, it was important to include some evaluation/feedback mechanism from the park rangers, before, during and/or after training.</p></td>

<h3><strong>STUDENT FEEDBACK</strong></h3>

<td>Mr Kelly (or Mark or whatever)<br />
 <br />
 Friday's software development exam was my last year 12 exam, and I felt awesome going into it because I feel like I really know the software course, and THAT was almost ALL because of your awesome website.<br />
 VCEIT was my true companion in sofdev this year, taking on the role of textbook and teacher, as neither my actual textbook nor my actual teacher seemed like they wanted to teach me the course (clsss was mainly devoted to SAC practice, which I didn't get a lot out of having already learned how to program beyond a VCE sofdev level before year twelve).<br />
 So I want to thank your website for being there for me and actually allowing me to self-study the course while it wasnt being taught in class. I was only able to move through the course due to the comprehensive notes you had on offer, filling in anything I was missing with a quick google search.<br />
 If you're at all interested, I feel like I nailed the exam (~90% but well see) and it was a great way to finish the year off, because of the confidence I built from your website up. I'm hoping for a study score in the 40's and I would have been clueless if it weren't for VCEIT.<br />
 Once more, thanks for existing and stuff, I look forward to reading the post mortem.</td>
