   <p class="examiner">The multiple-choice questions were answered well by many students. <br />
     Section B required students to demonstrate sound theoretical knowledge and to provide detailed and accurate responses. <br />
     The format of Section C was consistent with that of previous years and students&rsquo; responses were expected to refer to the case study. The key weakness in many responses in this section was a lack of depth and detail.<br />
     </p>
   <p class="examiner">During the examination, students should:<br />
     &#61623; endeavour to use correct IT terminology<br />
     &#61623; discuss all options when asked to justify a choice or compare one option with another<br />
     &#61623; respond to key instructional terms, such as &lsquo;state&rsquo;, &lsquo;explain&rsquo;, &lsquo;justify&rsquo; and &lsquo;describe&rsquo;<br />
     &#61623; re-read each question and their response to ensure that the question has been answered<br />
     &#61623; remove the case study insert from the question and answer book, and refer to it when completing Section C<br />
     &#61623; read the case study and questions carefully, and underline or highlight key words<br />
    &#61623; demonstrate their knowledge of the subject and apply that knowledge to the case study as general responses often result in low or no marks; knowledgeable, clear and appropriate responses receive full marks.</p></td>

 <p class="explanation">As it stands, the loop never exercises the 'and Found &lt;&gt; True' part of its continuation test. Adding option (A) lets the loop exit if the target is found, and the remainder of the array need not be uselessly searched.</p>
 <p class="explanation">Option (D) does improve the code, but it aids effectiveness (the output is more informative), not efficiency.</p>

 <!-- #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/indent.lbi" -->&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- #EndLibraryItem -->Endwhile</strong> <strong><br />
 End</strong></span><br />
 </p>
 <p>The reason for this error is</p>
 <p><strong>A. </strong>the variable A never changes.<br />
 <strong>B. </strong>a variable cannot be divided by 0.<br />
 <strong>C. </strong>the algorithm never exits the loop.<br />
 <strong>D. </strong>A and B are not good names for variables. </p>
 <p><span class="myanswer">Answer is B.</span></p>
 <p class="explanation">Rule out (D) because bad naming does not cause errors.<br />
 Eliminate (A) because variable A obviously
   <strong>does</strong> get changed in line 5.<br />
 It can't be (C) because variable B <strong>is</strong> decremented and the loop <strong>would</strong> end when it goes below zero. (Ignoring the division issue for now.)<br />
 That leaves (B) so we scrutinise it with an intense scrute, just to be sure. Yes, B will hit zero before the loop ends, and B is the (divisor? minuend? dividend? I can never remember that arithmetic stuff) number at the bottom of the divide. So there will be a division by zero error.<br />
 Even in these modern times, division by zero is still frowned upon by most people.

 <p class="explanation">(a) penetration testing does not find whether a solution is producing required results.<br />
 (b) pen testing is actually <strong>testing</strong> to see whether a system works properly <strong>before</strong> it's implemented. Pen tests should not be carried out during evaluation.</p>

 <p>a. Explain how a bubble sort works. 2 marks
 
 [6 lines]
</p>
 <p class="myanswer">A bubble sort checks each item in the data set to see if it is in the correct sort order compared to the following item. If they are in the wrong order, the items are swapped. When the end of the data set is reached, the process is repeated until no further swaps are needed.</p> <p><span class="examiner">Average mark 40%</span></p>
 <p class="examiner">Many students had difficulty clearly explaining their answer to this question. Very few students were able to provide accurate definitions and many were superficial. Reponses needed to include details of how items were swapped and that swapping is repeated in subsequent passes until all items are sorted.<br />
   Students are encouraged to keep a glossary of key terms throughout the year (in addition to the glossary in the study design) and include key programming concepts in it. Students should also ensure that they use the allocated marks as a guide to the depth of response required.<br />
   The following is an example of a high-scoring response.<br />
   With each iteration of the sort, the biggest value is &lsquo;bubbled&rsquo; to the top of the list. This is done by comparing adjacent values, and if the leftmost value is bigger, a swap is made. This repeats until the largest value is at the top of the list, and repeats until all values have been placed in the right place.</p>
 <p>b. Briefly explain how a quick sort works and how this differs from a bubble sort. 2 marks [6 lines]</p>
 <p class="myanswer">- A quick sort recursively subdivides the data set into 2 parts and chooses a pivot value. All items in the part of the data set that are less than the pivot value are moved to the left of the pivot item, items greater than the pivot value are moved to the right of the pivot item. This is repeated until all items are sorted.</p>
 <p class="myanswer">- Compared to the bubble sort, the quick sort is more complex to code, but is usually more efficient with large data sets.</p>
 <p class="comment">Damn, Nelly - that's a tough one! Explaining shell sort and its difference to bubble sort - for only 2 marks is asking a lot. I predict that this question will  get shockingly-low marks. But it <strong>will</strong> identify the top SD candidates...</p>
 <p class="myanswer"><span class="examiner">Average mark 30%</span></p>
 <p class="examiner">As with part a., most students struggled to provide a complete and detailed response, with many missing the second part of the question &ndash; &lsquo;how this differs from a bubble sort&rsquo;.<br />
   The following are examples of high-scoring responses.<br />
   With each iteration, a value called a pivot is chosen from the list. For each other value, if it is greater than pivot it places it to the right, if it is less than, it places to left. The pivot is in the right place and on the two side lists. This differs from bubble sort as it is a divide and conquer algorithm, whereas bubble sort goes through one by one. Quick sort as a result is much faster.<br />
   A quick sort chooses a random pivot item and compared other items to that element until it has two subsets of elements higher and lower than the pivot. It then does the same to the sublists and so on till it&rsquo;s all sorted. The difference to the bubble sort is the creation of sublists rather than looping over one list.</p></td>

 <p class="examiner">Most students assumed that Andrew had indeed &lsquo;copied&rsquo; the code; however, the stem of the question stated that it &lsquo;looks very much like a commercial program&rsquo;. This assumption resulted in many students stating that if he removed the code, this would resolve the legal issue. The more appropriate response was to prove that that code was his intellectual property. With regard to the copyright issue, communicating with users and seeking permission within the software would resolve the issue.</p>

 <p align="left">CASE STUDY INSERT FOR SECTION C<br />
 Please remove from the centre of this book during reading time. </p>
 <p><strong>Case study</strong></p>
 <p class="comment">Note - Figure 1 was a drawing of a happy cow getting a tag attached to her ear. The image was not produced by VCAA so I have not included it here. In any case, it added nothing to the case study, unless you love drawings of cows and ear tags. In that case, I substitute a reasonable facsimile. Now, stop crying. There there.</p>
 <p> <img src="/m/pm/14s-cs00-cowtag.jpg" alt="Eartag" width="329" height="276" align="right" />The Wide Hill cattle station is in Central Australia and measures approximately 80 km by 50 km. It is situated 200 km from a town of about 100 people. Currently, there is a herd of approximately 30 000 cattle on the station. The station provides cattle for a variety of markets. Some require cattle of a certain weight, while others require cattle of a certain age. All cattle in Australia are registered with the <strong>Australian Cattle Identification System</strong> (ACIS) and, when cattle are bought and sold, the information must be transmitted to a national database that is available online. All cattle producers have login access to this information. The cattle carry a radiofrequency identification (RFID) tag that can be scanned easily by an electronic reader. This provides a unique RFID code for each animal. The electronic reader can also record the current weight of each animal through a sensor set up in the cattle yards. The RFID tag provides many advantages to producers as all cattle in Australia can be traced.</p>
 <p>   Mike McIntosh, the station&rsquo;s owner and manager, would like to expand the use of ACIS to help him work more efficiently and help him keep records that will provide information to improve his herd. He has identified a number of concerns he would like to address:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>Cattle from other stations get mixed in with Mike&rsquo;s herd and he wants to use the system to quickly identify these cattle. Currently, he has to read the animal&rsquo;s tag and check the RFID against his paper records to find out if it is one of his animals. If it is not one of his, he has to login to ACIS to find out where the animal belongs.   </li>
   <li>Currently, Mike&rsquo;s limited breeding information is kept on paper. In the future, Mike would like these records to be electronic. He hopes he will then be able to identify his best breeding stock and improve the quality of his herd.   </li>
   <li>Mike weighs cattle for certain markets (which specify a specific range) and he hopes to be able to produce cattle that grow quicker, using this weighing and his electronic breeding records.   </li>
   <li>Mike would also like to introduce some new breeding lines into his cattle and wants his records to keep track of these animals to see how they compare to the rest of the herd. If they do well, he will switch to these new breeding lines in the future.
     
   </li>
 </ul>
 <p>Mike recognises that the remote location of his cattle station may present some problems. The only access to the internet is from a satellite connection based at the station&rsquo;s homestead, where Mike&rsquo;s office is. The only other form of communication around the station is via handheld radios. Mike has set up a wi-fi network of beacons around the homestead so that the buildings and cattle yards within 400 m of the main house have wi-fi available.<br />
   The weighing and scanning set-up is portable and can be moved to any one of six yards located around the station as well as the main homestead yards. However, the only way of communicating with Mike&rsquo;s office is through a simple radio voice system when Mike is away from the homestead and out of wi-fi range. He is considering using a satellite system to transfer data to and from the homestead&rsquo;s computer.</p>
 <p>   Mike would like to have a new software solution that will scan an animal&rsquo;s RFID tag and enter its weight into his records while he is using a tablet computer in any of his cattle yards. He would then like to be able to upload these records onto the homestead&rsquo;s computer.<br />
   He would also like the following information to be stored and displayed on the tablet:</p>
 <ul>
   <li>whether each animal belongs to him</li>
   <li>where each animal was born and its parentage</li>
   <li>the age of each animal</li>
   <li>a comparison of each individual animal&rsquo;s weight with the average for the herd (at that age)</li>
   <li>any other relevant information about the cattle (e.g. how many calves each cow has produced) </li>
 </ul>
 <p>On viewing this information, Mike can then make a decision as to what to do with each animal and direct his station workers accordingly. As he has approximately 30 000 cattle on the station, these decisions need to be made quickly. If he finds an animal with an excellent growth rate, for example, he may wish to keep it for future breeding.</p>
 <p>   Mike has contracted Nicole to design and develop his new Cattle Station Software (CSS) to provide all the extra information. The new software must be able to provide communication between his office in the homestead and the portable weighing and scanning system when it is used at each of the six cattle yards around the station.<br />

 <td width="666" valign="top"><p align="left"><strong>Question 1</strong> (4 marks)</p>
 <p align="left"> Nicole&rsquo;s office is 600 km from the Wide Hill cattle station. She needs to begin the analysis as soon as possible. There are four techniques Nicole could use to help her with her analysis: observation, interviews, questionnaires and reviews of Wide Hill&rsquo;s software documentation.<br />
 Outline a major strength of each of these techniques. [3 lines per topic]</p>
 <p align="left" class="explanation">Hmmm. Does the question mean a major strength for <strong>Nicole</strong>, 600km away? Answers <strong>should</strong> always relate to the case study, but the question does not focus on Nicole's special circumstances. Play it safe and focus on this situation, I'd say.</p>
 <p><strong>Observation</strong></p>
 <ul>
   <li class="myanswer">direct, first-hand, primary evidence can be obtained. All other secondary evidence must be filtered through other people's interpretations and choice of what to report.</li>
   <li class="myanswer">can get a better understanding of the realities of the context of the solution;</li>
   <li><span class="myanswer">direct observation may unearth facts that farm workers had considered self-evident and unworthy of mention. For example, farmhands know that semi-wild cattle are huge and nasty, so noone should get near them without a steel enclosure; a city-girl like Nicole might have been planning a system that involved treating cattle like they were friendly, tame dairy cows. Or Nicole may realise first-hand the rigors that equipment</span> <span class="myanswer">must cope with in 50 degree temperatures and clouds of choking dust - something that the workers may not have mentioned since they took it for granted.</span></li>
 </ul>
 <p><strong>Interviews</strong></p>
 <ul>
   <li class="myanswer">can get more detailed information than would be likely if it had to be written down</li>
   <li class="myanswer">can elicit personal feelings and reactions. People (especially men) are much less likely to open up emotionally in writing compared with face-to-face conversation.</li>
   <li class="myanswer">the exchange is more dynamic and responsive - planned questions may be modified in the light of previous answers, and follow-up questions asked after an unexpected or illuminating answer</li>
   <li class="myanswer">the personal touch may 'loosen up' up uncooperative subjects and make them more responsive. These people may easily refuse to fill in a questionnaire, but will feel sheepish about rudely refusing to talk directly to a visitor.</li>
   <li class="myanswer">body language, tone of voice, hesitation, and gestures can be valuable clues to deeper unexpressed truths behind a person's words. Irony, sarcasm, reluctance, emotion can all be expressed and detected.and review</li>
 </ul>
 <p><strong>Questionnaires </strong></p>
 <ul>
   <li class="myanswer">for<strong> Nicole</strong>, these are easy to accomplish. People need not travel to a remote location. Questionnaires can be handled by mail or email.</li>
   <li class="myanswer">are quick to fill in, so respondents are more likely to comply</li>
   <li class="myanswer">can gather a lot of information from large groups of people quickly, cheaply and easily</li>
   <li class="myanswer">responses with restricted sets of answers are easy to enter into an information system</li>
 </ul>
 <p><strong>Reviews</strong> (of software documentation)</p>
 <p class="comment">(Assuming that this refers to <em>user documentation</em> and not <em>internal documentation</em>...)</p>
 <ul>
   <li class="myanswer">the documentation would tell Nicole what the existing software was capable of (i.e. scope)</li>
   <li class="myanswer">it could reveal areas of functionality that need to be improved, removed, or added</li>
 </ul>
 <p class="examiner">Most students handled the first three stated techniques well; however, many students misinterpreted &lsquo;Reviews&rsquo;. The stem of the question stated one of the techniques that could be used to help with the analysis was &lsquo;reviews of Wide Hill&rsquo;s software documentation&rsquo;, that is, the technique would review the current documentation, not the software. Many students assumed the reviews had already been conducted and this was incorrect.<br />
   It is important that students remember that responses in Section C must apply to the case study. So when describing the strength of a technique, it was expected that the strength would be applicable to Wide Hill.<br />
   The following is an example of a high-scoring response.<br />
   &#61623; Observation Can see the current system at work and detect problems that the cattle station&rsquo;s staff may not see<br />
   &#61623; Interviews Able to directly know what Mike and the station workers are having trouble with, and discuss their options with Nicole<br />

   Many students were unable to identify the types of validation occurring in this question and in Question 3a. It is important that students apply validation during school-assessed coursework.

 <p class="question">Mike wants to use a tablet to record the weight of the cattle. Nicole tells him that the tablet has 512 MB of primary storage (RAM) and 16 GB of secondary storage. She could go to 32 GB of secondary storage, but she cannot alter the 512 MB of RAM. </p>
 <p class="question">Apart from cost, outline the technical difference between the two types of storage used on the tablet and how this may affect access to the data stored. [5 lines]</p>
 <p class="myanswer">Data access speed.</p>
 <p class="myanswer">RAM (random access memory) is used during the execution of a program to hold the program's executable code and the data it is using during execution. It is very quick to read and write to RAM. Primary storage  is volatile - its contents are lost when the program or the device is shut down. If the program plus its necessary runtime variables, arrays etc cannot fit in primary storage, the program will either crash, fail to start, or resort to swapping data in and out of slow secondary storage to get enough room to run the software.</p>
 <p class="myanswer">Secondary storage (e.g. hard disk, SSD, SD card) is non-volatile storage used to permanently store executable code and data between program executions. Data here can also be accessed by a running program. It is usually much slower to access than RAM, which is why computers will little RAM will run slowly as they resort to using secondary storage page files to act a slow alternative to primary storage.</p>
 <p class="comment">It's interesting to see that the examiners are no longer spelling out &quot;MB&quot; and &quot;GB&quot; units. We're all growing up! </p>

 <p class="comment"><span class="examiner">Students struggled to provide clear and technically accurate responses to this question. The question had two parts and many students missed the second half of the question. Students are encouraged to read and re-read the question throughout the examination and then do the same for their response.<br />
   The following is an example of a possible response: Primary storage is non-permanent memory used to hold temporary data and is accessed faster than secondary storage. Data in secondary storage is slower to access but data is stored permanently even after the device is turned off.</span></p>

 <p class="comment">All right! Settle down, petals. Chris! Put down that chair. I don't CARE - just put it down. I know this could get messy. The figures shown above assume there are exactly 1,000,000 bytes in a megabyte, obeying the new official IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) redefined <a href="http://www.iec.ch/si/binary.htm">definition</a> of 'megabyte' as exactly 1,000,000 bytes (which nearly everyone in the industry ignores).</p>
 <p class="comment">Were the examiners instead thinking of the new (horrible) <strong>mebibyte</strong> (MiB) unit (1 mebibyte = the traditional 1,046,576 bytes), in which case the answers would have been <strong>5.7</strong> and <strong>19.0</strong> respectively?</p>

 <p class="examiner">Minimum expected file size 5&ndash;6 MB <br />
   Maximum expected file size 19&ndash;20 MB<br />
   Students were asked to estimate the minimum and maximum file sizes in megabytes, but many gave their answers in bytes or kilobytes. Students are reminded to read questions carefully. Students who did answer correctly often showed their working and conversion. <br />
   Either 1024 kilobytes or 1000 kilobytes could have been used.<br />
   An example of a calculation follows:<br />
   200 &times; 30 000 = 6 000 000 bytes<br />
   1 MB = 1000 KB = 1 000 000 bytes<br />

 <td valign="top" ><p class="question"><strong>Question 9</strong> (6 marks)</p>
 <p class="question"> For the software solution to be successful, rapid searching of the records on the ACIS code is essential. Nicole suggests using a random access file stored on the homestead&rsquo;s computer and sorted on the ACIS code. Also, with 100 000 records, it would be best to read a record only when required and modify it when required.</p>
 <p class="question">   Adam, a programmer friend, suggests using a sequential file sorted on the ACIS code. When the program starts up, it will load all the data from the homestead&rsquo;s computer onto the tablet and all records will be stored in a one-dimensional array that will then be searched. When the program is shut down, the file will be rewritten back onto the homestead&rsquo;s computer.</p>
 <p class="comment">Hang on one cotton-picking minute. Did you say the records will be stored in a <strong>one-dimensional</strong> array? How would THAT work? There are 5 fields (see <a href="#c4">Q4</a>). Would the fields in each record be concatenated to form a single string? And then parsed for processing. And then again concatenated for storage? Or would each array index contain a single field, requiring 5 array accesses to gather 1 record? That would make sorting a massive pain! Alan, the silly duffer, should have used a 2D array. Fortunately this does not seem to affect the marking of any questions. I'm not sure whether or not the examiners meant Adam's method to have this serious weakness...</p>
 <p class="examiner">This question was poorly answered by the majority of students. Most students picked up on the key words &lsquo;random access file&rsquo; and &lsquo;sequential file&rsquo; in the question and wrote lengthy descriptions of these file types; however, the question asked students to describe the advantage of each complete method outlined. So students should have taken on board the full description of file type, file transfer and updating data.</p>
 <p>a. Describe <strong>one </strong>advantage of Nicole&rsquo;s method. 2 marks [6 lines]</p>
 <ul>
   <li class="myanswer">It consumes relatively little RAM on the tablet, since the data does not need to be copied to the portable device.</li>
   <li class="myanswer">     The system would start up more quickly since the large data transfers of Adam's method would not be necessary.
   </li>

   <li class="myanswer">Once the data has been loaded, the tablet could be used productively even if the internet connection were lost for a while. Once the link was re-established, the modified data could be synced. </li>
 </ul>
 <p class="examiner">Reading data (locally) from the tablet is faster than reading it over a network and continually having to read/write back. In addition, work can continue when out of wi-fi range.</p>
 <p class="examiner">Average mark <strong>20%</strong></p>
 <p>c. Suggest an alternative method that may overcome a problem with either Nicole&rsquo;s or Adam&rsquo;s method. Justify your suggestion. 2 marks [6 lines]</p>
 <p class="myanswer">- A copy of the data could be permanently stored in the tablet's secondary storage (e.g. SD card). When changes to the data occurred (either using the tablet or on the homestead computer), the changes could be synced wirelessly. Since changes would be relatively small, syncing would not take much time nor bandwidth. </p>
 <p class="myanswer">This would overcome the Nicole's potential problem with slow access speeds, and Adam's potential problem with RAM shortage.</p>
 <p class="myanswer"><span class="explanation">Note: the tablet has 512MB of RAM [see <a href="#c7">Q7</a>], so even the biggest data file (20MB) <em>should</em> still comfortably fit into the tablet with the OS and CSS program using Adam's method</span><span class="explanation">.</span></p>
 <p class="myanswer">- Alternatively, Adam's slow sequential file sorting problem could be alleviated by using an index to keep track of records' order without having to physically more records in RAM.</p>
 <p class="myanswer">- Adam should use  a 2D array so a record's fields could more easily be managed and accessed programmatically.</p>
 <p class="examiner">An alternative to these methods would be one that combines elements of each to ensure ease of use and speed.<br />
   The following are examples of high-scoring responses.<br />
   Have the data stored as a random access file on the tablet itself and backup the data to the computer at the end of each day for security and transmission to the ACIS database. This method combines the efficiency of Nicole&rsquo;s method with the convenience of Adam&rsquo;s method and adds a redundancy backup.<br />
   The files could be sent to the tablet each day and then be access from a random access file while needed, keeping them secuer and improving speed. At the end of the day they would be sent back to the homestead computer.</p>

 <p class="comment"> Is this suggesting that using a particular search would double the number of records? <strong>Can't be.</strong></p>

   &#61623; a binary search<br />
   The maximum number of times a record would need to be read would increase by one (from 15 to 16) as only the record in the middle of the list is read because the list is halved each time.</p>

 <p class="examiner">In general, students were able to identify the need to measure the file transfer time. However, it is important that students pay attention to the task word in each question. For full marks students needed to provide the procedure(s) for testing at least one file size under specific test conditions, indicating a technique for measuring transfer time. The response needed to relate to the specific details in the question.<br />
   The following are examples of high-scoring responses.<br />
   Nicole could create a file with 100 000 simple records. With the tablet under the stated conditions. Nicole could send the file multiple times to the tablet recording how long each copy takes. The average copy time can then be calculated.<br />

 <p> Nicole has been working on the interface for the CSS. She knows that when Mike is weighing the cattle, he will be required to make split-second decisions based on the information presented to him by the software. This makes the interface design very important as Mike will need all relevant information in front of him in order to make those decisions.</p>

 <p class="myanswer">It's obvious that human brains interpret analogue and pictorial information far more quickly and with less chance of error than they do when it's written or numeric. A glance at a graph gives more instant - albeit less detailed - information than a paragraph of writing or a table of numbers.</p>
 <p class="myanswer">Since speed is of the essence in Mike's case, the graphical, iconic presentation of the information would be valuable. The slight loss of details would be a trivial cost if he could get enough vital information with a quick glance.</p>
 <p class="explanation">Why do you think road signs use simple images with minimal writing? <br />

 <p class="explanation">Try describing <em>that</em> information in words for motorists travelling at speed.</p>
 <p class="examiner">Students could have recommended either interface option but needed to provide a detailed response as to why that option was recommended. Many students provided only one reason as to why that option was recommended. Students should ensure they take note of the mark allocation as this will often give a guideline as to the depth of response required.<br />
   A possible response could have been: Option A &ndash; Mike needs a visual representation of growth. The graph will provide much clearer information that does not require interpretation or prior knowledge, and anyone could use it. It could contain the average growth tracked on one line with the animal&rsquo;s growth on another to determine good or poor growth. The map will allow Mike to quickly gauge the location of the animals (prior to roundup) and determine whether they should be relocated based on pasture available in each paddock and whether the animals need to put on weight or not. This information is clear and much more easily understood.</p>

 <p class="question"> Mike feels that a satellite connection is the only option for connecting the outlying cattle yards. Nicole suggests that this would be a very expensive option and that Mike should consider using microwave. Mike says that he has heard there are some issues with using microwave as a method of transmitting data.</p>
 <p class="question"> State two characteristics of microwave transmission that Nicole needs to explain to Mike before installing it on Wide Hill cattle station. Explain the relevance of each of these characteristics for the cattle station.</p>
 <p class="question"> Characteristic 1 [1 line] <span class="myanswer">It operates on a line-of-sight.</span></p>
 <p class="question">Explanation [3 lines] </p>
 <p class="myanswer">If the signal is blocked by an obstruction (like a hand in front of the beam from a torch) the signal is lost. Unlike radio, microwave signals do not penetrate obstacles. </p>
 <p class="myanswer">So the transmitter must be placed high enough at the homestead to clear all hills and buildings between itself and the location of the receiver.</p>
 <p>Characteristic 2 [1 line] <span class="myanswer">It's narrow and directional.</span></p>
 <p>Explanation [3 lines]</p>
 <p class="myanswer">Unlike radio waves which (usually) travel in all directions from an emitter. Microwave signals travel as a narrow beam in a single direction - like a laser beam.</p>
 <p class="myanswer">So, the microwave dish will need to be moveable in order to aim at its intended data recipient.</p>
 <p class="comment">I think this question will have caught a few students and teachers off-guard. <br />
   Microwave has never received this sort of attention in an exam before! <br />
   I predict the state average for this question will be about 25% !</p>
 <p class="explanation">The peculiar drum-shaped objects you see on the tops and sides of tall buildings are microwave dishes, high up to clear obstacles and aimed precisely at a single destination dish.</p>
 <p class="examiner">Many students struggled to respond with the detail required and with technically accurate information. It was clear that many did not know a great deal about microwave transmission. The most appropriate characteristic to discuss was &lsquo;interference of signal&rsquo;. Microwave signals need a line of sight between the cattle yard and the homestead and, in addition, weather conditions may interfere with the signal.

 <p> Nicole is concerned that if the hardware fails or is destroyed by accident, all of the cattle station&rsquo;s records would be lost and so would years of information. Mike suggests that the records be copied onto a DVD each week and stored in his filing cabinet.</p>
 <p>a. State <strong>one</strong> potential fault with this method. 1 mark [2 lines]</p>
 <ul>
   <li class="myanswer">DVDs deteriorate with age and may lose data.</li>
   <li class="myanswer">DVDs are easily scratched and become unreadable. 
     <ul>
       <li><span class="explanation">Don't just say DVDs are easily scratched. That in itself is not a fault in terms of data backup. Cats are also easily scratched, but that does not impede their catability&#8482;. The fact that DVD scratchability leads to unreadability is the fault. Make sure you finish your train of thought and explain the relevance of your answer.</span></li>
     </ul>
   </li>
   <li class="myanswer">Storing the backup DVDs in the same place as the original data will be dangerous. If the original data is stolen or destroyed by fire/flood/ninja attack etc, the backups could easily suffer the same fate.

   <li class="myanswer">Backing up only weekly could still lose up to 6 days' data in a disaster.</li>

You realise this is not <strong>really </strong>important in this case. Remember that your answers must to be relevant to the case study. Cross this answer out and find a more relevant response.</span></li>
   </ul>
 <p class="explanation">Be sure to pay attention to <strong>all </strong>parts of the question. Fixating only on the qualities of the DVD might make you forget to address the issue of the storage in the filing cabinet and the weekly schedule! When you think you've finished answering a question, READ IT AGAIN and discover what you missed the first time. In SD exams, it <strong>will be there</strong>.</p>
 <p class="examiner">Students tended to focus on the DVD being scratched and thus losing data. A more appropriate response would have discussed the backup method identified &ndash; storing the DVDs in a filing cabinet. Any data in a filing cabinet could be stolen or destroyed by natural disaster. This method offers little data protection.</p>

 </ul>
 <p class="explanation">You only get 1 mark for this. Don't write an essay about it.</p>
 <p class="examiner">When stating a method, students should have considered the storage media, type of backup method and storage location, such as cloud-based and fireproof safe. Some students also indicated who was responsible for the backup. Many suggested multiple DVDs or a hard drive, or storing off site (which was not practical in a remote location), without providing additional details.</p>

 <p> Each time the cattle is rounded up for weighing, Mike employs extra staff on-site. The extra staff are usually a mix of contracted farmhands and backpackers.

A more appropriate response would have included the following: disgruntled employees frustrated as they can&rsquo;t get their jobs done, farmhands complaining to Mike about the lack of &lsquo;free internet&rsquo;, etc. Students, however, were able to come up with a variety of methods to minimise the conflict. A range of reasonable responses were accepted.<br />
   The following is an example of a high-scoring response.<br />
   The staff many complain that with all the staff accessing the internet via the Wi-Fi, that the networks bandwidth many be taken up and therefore its speed many reduce significantly. This could be fixed by setting data limits for those connecting to the network via login so no member of staff uses too much or slows the network down as much.</p>
