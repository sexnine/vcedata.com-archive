  <td ><p class="examiner">General Comments</p>
    <p class="examiner">Generally, responses drawing on knowledge gained from completing practical activities during the learning process were the most successful. High-scoring students had, for example, a clear understanding of the influence of design elements on the appearance of websites, and the ability to select and apply test data when developing solutions for information problems. They could also choose appropriate data types when creating tables for a relational database management system and design queries and formulas using logical conditions that returned information for specified purposes.</p>
    <p class="examiner">      Where questions required extended responses, many students completed most of the task but did not address all parts of the task. For example, some students provided accurate descriptions of either a database or spreadsheet solution but failed to provide test data for the second requirement. For example, many successful responses had been divided into sections, with detailed answers set out under headings for each part of the question.</p>
    <p class="examiner">      While the majority of students could design a website and annotate their design to explain the relationships between the features of their design and the requirements of the design brief (<a href="#b11">Section B, Question 11</a>), a significant number mistakenly used their annotations to simply describe fonts, sizes and colours without explaining their purpose. With the exception of navigation, few students were able to recommend a design element related to the functionality of a website (<a href="#b9b">Section B, Question 9b</a>.).</p>
    <p class="examiner">      Students and teachers are reminded that a number of key knowledge points are expressed in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. For example, they require an understanding of how particular functions or techniques increase the efficiency of collecting data (Unit 3, Outcome 2) or the ability to create criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of information management strategies (Unit 4, Outcome 2). Demonstrating an understanding of these key knowledge points involves explaining how the function or technique reduces time, cost or effort in the case of efficiency, or how a management strategy improves data integrity, security, ease of retrieval and currency of files in the case of effectiveness. It is not sufficient to simply use the words &lsquo;efficient&rsquo; or &lsquo;effective&rsquo;.</p>
    <p class="examiner">    In general, responses that provided examples taken from the context of the scenarios were the most successful.</p></td>

 <td><p><strong><a name="a1" id="a1"></a>Question 1</strong></p>
 <p> When Old Time Gardeners decides to re-landscape a suburban parkland, it sets up a website so that local residents can view each stage of the construction.<br />
 This type of online community is best described as</p>
 <p><strong>A.</strong> social.<br />
  <strong>B.</strong> collaboration.<br />
  <strong>C.</strong> project-based.<br />
  <strong>D.</strong> knowledge-sharing.</p>
 <p class="myanswer">Answer is C. But I don't like it.</p>
 <p class="myanswer">Not an easy starter for 2013's exam.<br />
   The study design mentions 3 types of online communities - social, work-based and project/interest-based.</p>
 <p class="myanswer">   (A) is true insofar as the gardeners are communicating with society, but it's not a &quot;get together and meet people&quot; sort of &quot;social&quot; website.<br />
   (B) is not one of the 3 designated types.<br />
   (C) is a designated type, and closer to the truth than (A).<br />
   (D) is accurate in that the OTGs are sharing knowledge with local residents, but it's not one of the official 3 types.<br />
 </p>
 <p class="comment"> I originally went for (D), forgetting the study design had listed the 3 official types. Sigh.<br />
   </p>
 <p class="comment">OFFICIAL RANT BEGINS</p>
 <p class="comment">But just because the study design lists 3 types after the word &quot;including&quot;, that does not mean that there is <strong>no such thing</strong> as a knowledge-sharing website. <br />
   What on earth is <strong>this</strong> site?</p>
 <p class="comment">Can the OTG site <strong>not</strong> be described as 'knowledge sharing'? Is that not <strong>true</strong>? Of course it is.<br />
   
   Is the VCAA official answer <strong>more</strong> true just because only 3 types (out of an infinite number) are listed in the study design? I don't think so. <br />
   A project-based online community is meant to serve <strong>the people on the project </strong>- not outsiders like the local residents! Option D is actually better.</p>
 <p class="comment">So  since the aim of section A is to &quot;Choose the response that is <strong>correct</strong> or that <strong>best answers</strong> the question.&quot;, (D) is most correct.<br />
   Perhaps the question should have been,  &quot;Of the 3 types of online community named in the study design, which most closely matches the OTG online community?&quot;<br />
   That way, students would not accidentally choose an option that is <strong>true</strong> and <strong>accurate</strong> and get the answer  totally wrong! Grrr.</p>
 <p class="comment">But when choosing answers, kiddies, remember Mr Kelly's Golden Rule - <strong>The study design is always right</strong>.</p>
 <p class="comment">But let's not get bogged down now in petty criticism of VCAA. <br />
   This is only question 1 ... there's <strong>plenty</strong> of time left.</p>
 <p class="comment"><img src="/m/rainbows-unicorns.jpg" width="180" height="188" alt="Rainbows and Unicorns" /></p>
 <p class="comment">No. Must relax. Rainbows and unicorns. Peace and harmony. VCAA is not the enemy...<br />

 <p>Evaluating a solution involves <br />
  <strong>A. </strong>determining the evaluation criteria. <br />
  <strong>B.</strong> testing whether the solution does what it was intended to do. <br />
  <strong>C.</strong> reporting on the extent to which the solution meets the requirements of the user.<br />
  <strong>D.</strong> determining what information the solution has to provide and what data is needed to produce it.</p>
 <p class="myanswer">Answer is C.</p>
 <p class="myanswer">(A) is done during design, and is a prelude to evaluation.<br />
  (B) is done during development.<br />
  (D) is done during analysis.
  <br />
  (C) is the only one that requires the solution to be finished before it can take place, which is when evaluation happens.

 <p>A local library wants to update its website so that new users can easily access the online catalogue. The most suitable form of user documentation would be a <br />
  <strong>A.</strong> quick start guide. <br />
  <strong>B.</strong> table of contents. <br />
  <strong>C.</strong> technical manual.<br />
  <strong>D.</strong> Help Desk email contact.</p>
 <p class="myanswer">Answer is A. </p>
 <p class="myanswer">The quick start quide is appropriate for new users since they would only need enough information to get them started.<br />
 The other options are not listed in the study design (p.36) as being required, which is a clue that they would not be right, but still look them over...<br />
 A table of contents (B) does not actually give useful information... it only tells you where the information can be found.<br />
 A technical manual (C) is irrelevant to 
 users' needs.<br />
 An email contact (D) might be handy, but as the <em>sole</em> source of documentation it would be inconvenient for staff, and slow for users to get supplied with information. </p>

  <strong>B.</strong> a swipe card. <br />
  <strong>C.</strong> a thumb print.<br />

  </p>
 <p class="myanswer">A PIN - Personal Identification Number - is data, not a physical device, as is an encryption key. A thumb print is biometric data, and while it is physical, you don't usually refer to your fingers as 'devices.'<br />

 <p>A solution developer wants to test the efficiency of using the date convention of mm/dd/yyyy for an online sales form to be used in a global market. He tracks the results of 100 users who were required to enter the current date using this convention. The best measure to indicate the efficiency of using this convention is <br />
  <strong>A.</strong> how quickly each user enters the date. <br />
  <strong>B.</strong> the percentage of users who enter complete dates. <br />
  <strong>C.</strong> the number of users who accurately enter the current date. <br />
  <strong>D.</strong> the number of error messages received by users to indicate incorrect date order.</p>
 <p class="myanswer">Answer is A.</p>
 <p class="myanswer">When you get a question with the words &quot;efficiency&quot; or &quot;effectiveness&quot; in them, it can be easy to eliminate options. To measure efficiency, the only option that refers to time, money, labour or ease-of-use is the issue of time/speed implied in (A).<br />
 The number of people entering complete dates is a matter of accuracy, which is an effectiveness measure.<br />
 (C) is also obviously an accuracy measure, and even uses the word &quot;accurately&quot;.<br />
 The error messages in (D) is also a clear indicator of accuracy, so it can be also ruled out quickly.</p>

 <p><img src="/m/pm/13i-a6.jpg" width="602" height="388" alt="A6" /></p>
 <p class="myanswer">Answer is B.</p>
 <p class="myanswer">Rule out (C) and (D) immediately because it's silly to have members' financial or personal data open to the public.<br />
  That leaves the question of whether &quot;login &amp; password&quot; should be open to the public.</p>
 <p class="myanswer">But I'm wondering what &quot;login and password <strong>information</strong>&quot; means in terms of a website. Does it mean that lists of users' login names and passwords are open to the public? That would be silly.<br />
  </p>
 <p class="myanswer">Or does it mean that a login <strong>page</strong> is open to the public - which makes sense since it has to be public so members can get into the 'closed' area of the site. I'd have to assume this one, since the alternative is dumber than a sackful of senile spaniels.</p>

 <td><p><strong><a name="a11" id="a11"></a>Question 11 </strong></p>
  <p>Which one of the following is the best validation technique for the Country field? <br />
 <strong>A.</strong> a range check <br />
 <strong>B.</strong> an input mask <br />
 <strong>C.</strong> a required field<br />
 <strong>D.</strong> a dropdown box</p>
  <p class="myanswer">Answer is D.</p>
  <p class="myanswer">I really don't know about this one.</p>
  <p class="myanswer">To start off by eliminating the obvious, an input mask (B) is used to ensure the formatting of input data (e.g. of a credit card number) is correct - the dashes are in the right places, characters are text/numeric where they should be, et cetera. This is inappropriate for a text field such as Country.<br />
  </p>
  <p class="myanswer">A range check (A) usually applies to a numeric datum to check that it is within acceptable limits. But a range check could also mean that data is contained within a limited list of options, so it <strong>could</strong> apply in this case.</p>
  <p class="myanswer">(C) is a bit odd. &quot;A required field&quot; is hardly a 'technique', but let's ignore poor expression for a minute. Making the Country field required would make sense if the organisation had foreign customers: the question does not specify whether it does or not. Making it a required field, would ensure a value was entered, but it would not check that it was a legitimate country. So it's not as valuable as A or D, which do force users to enter a valid item.</p>
  <p class="myanswer">In (D), a &quot;dropdown box&quot; is another rather quaint examiner term, like the &quot;drop list&quot; they used in the in <a href="/p/postmortem-2008i.htm#A12">question A12 in  2008</a>. Most people talk about dropdown <strong>lists</strong> or <strong>menus</strong>, not boxes. But let's assume they meant one of those... A dropdown list or menu is a way of enforcing selection from a limited list of acceptable options (see above), even though choosing a country from a list of approximately 200 items is rather frustrating. (You can see it in action in eBay's 'Advanced Search' page, under 'Location'.)</p>
  <p class="myanswer">So, in brief, it could be (A) because it could restrict input data to those that match an item existing in a limited list.<br />
 It won't be (B), so cross that out.<br />
 (C) is a validation technique, but options A and D provide the same service, but offer more value.<br />
 (D) is a control that
 enforces option (A) and additionally stops the user free-typing, which is always a good idea.</p>
  <p class="myanswer">So let's say (D).<br />

 <td><p><em>Use the following information to answer Questions 12 and 13. </em></p>
 <p>The local cinema holds a monthly mini-festival, where the owner chooses a famous director and screens a selection of their movies. To assist with matching directors and movies, the owner has decided to create a relational database management system (RDBMS) based on the following tables. </p>
 <p><img src="/m/pm/13i-a12-13.jpg" width="506" height="203" alt="A12-A13" /></p>
 <p><strong><a name="a12" id="a12"></a>Question 12 </strong></p>
 <p>The primary key in the Movie table ensures that <br />
  <strong>A.</strong> a movie has a unique identity. <br />
  <strong>B.</strong> a director has a unique identity. <br />
  <strong>C.</strong> two directors cannot have the same LastName.<br />
  <strong>D.</strong> a director cannot be credited with the wrong movie.</p>
 <p class="myanswer">Answer is A.</p>
 <p class="myanswer">Students would need to recognise that after the names &quot;DirectorID&quot; and &quot;MovieID&quot; was this symbol...</p>
 <p class="myanswer"><img src="/m/primary-key-8timeszoom.jpg" width="113" height="61" alt="primary key zoomed" /></p>
 <p class="myanswer">means that the field is a primary key for that table. However, when printed at about 11 points in an exam the symbol is <strong>very</strong> obscure. The version shown above was only obtained after zooming the PDF of the exam in to 800% !</p>
 <p class="myanswer">The primary key field (or fields) of a table is used to uniquely distinguish each record in that table from all of the other records in that table. This is why your parents gave their children different names, unlike in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newhart">Newhart TV show</a>, where one character always introduced himself with &quot;Hi, I'm Larry;&nbsp;this is my brother Darryl, and this is my other brother Darryl.&quot;</p>
 <p class="myanswer">The primary key is usually an account number or arbitrary ID that can be generated by the organisation and guaranteed to be unique, unlike names or other real personal data.</p>
 <p class="myanswer">Let's walk through the answer. <br />
   - 
   Option (B) relates to the Director table, not the Movie table referred to in the question. However it is true that the DirectorID field uniquely identifies each director in the Director table.<br />
  - It would be unreasonable to expect that no two directors in the history of cinema can have the same LastName, so (C) can be eliminated without knowing anything about primary keys. Thank Dog for common sense.<br />
  - It would be beyond the scope of a database to prevent a data entry person crediting a director with the wrong movie. I could tell a database that Fred Smith directed <em>Spongebob Squarepants Goes Mental</em> - and how could the database challenge me unless it was equipped with artificial intelligence and a link to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">IMDB</a>? So common sense eliminates another option!</p>
 <p class="myanswer">And yes, I <strong>do</strong> hope they make <em>Spongebob Squarepants Goes Mental</em>. I really do.<br />

 <p>The relationship the owner has created between the primary key in the Director table and the foreign key in the Movie table is needed if fans using the website want to <br />
  <strong>A.</strong> sort the movies in order of release date. <br />
  <strong>B.</strong> search for all directors born in the 20th century. <br />
  <strong>C.</strong> sort the directors' last names in alphabetical order.<br />
  <strong>D.</strong> search for movies in a particular language by a director.</p>
 <p class="myanswer">Answer is D.</p>
 <p class="myanswer">A relationship between tables allows the looking up of related data: in this case, the connection between a particular director and a list of movies. A single table gives information about one topic, such as directors, without reference to related information, such as their movies. So, you can find their last names (C) and dates of birth (B) without a relationship to another table.<br />
  To sort movies by name (A), you don't need related information about 
 their directors, so that's not it.<br />
 The only option that draws data from <strong>both</strong> tables is (D)... you need the Director table to get the director's name, and the Movie table to find the language of the director's movies. </p>

 <p class="myanswer">Answer is C - but a judge could rule against me. I don't like it.</p>
 <p class="myanswer">The IPA only applies to Victorian state government departments and agencies, so rule out (D).<br />
  (B) probably really should refer to people damaging original data rather than seeing copies of the data.<br />

 <p class="myanswer">They are subject to the HRA, so, it comes down to the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/hra2001144/">requirements of the Health Records Act</a>. <br />
  Have they met their legal obligations or not? </p>
 <p class="myanswer">Section C, part A says an object of the act is to &quot;require responsible handling of health information in the public   and private sectors&quot;. In the <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/hra2001144/sch1.html">Health Privacy Principles</a>, Principle 4, &quot;Data Security and Data Retention&quot;, it requires that &quot;An organisation must take reasonable steps to protect the health  information it holds from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access,  modification or disclosure.&quot;</p>
 <p class="myanswer">This is where it gets argumentative. The clinic &quot;deleted all the patient files from the hard disks before donating the old computers.&quot;</p>
 <p class="myanswer">So choose one of the following:<br />
  a. Deleting the data was Good. That's reasonable. Choose option (A).<br />
  c. They failed to wipe the disks, so deleted files could be undeleted. That's unreasonable. Choose option (C).</p>

 <p class="comment">This question, I believe, is unreasonable.

 <p class="comment">This is really getting on my wick. This format of a Chen-style ERD is solely based on an example given in <a href="http://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/Documents/vce/infotech/IT-Apps-samp.pdf">VCAA's sample ITA questions</a> published in 2010. Nowhere are the colour codings explained. What does the grey shading <strong>mean</strong> exactly? We have to interpret that it indicates a key field. Why? Because the sample ERD has ID fields in its white elipses. Where is this explained? How are students meant to deduce that key knowledge from the 2010 sample question?</p>
 <p class="comment">And if the colour coding is in fact some sort of <strong>official rule</strong> mandated by the precedent of the sample question, the exam question itself has violated it because in the sample questions, entities are black with white text: in the exam question, entities are white. Is that significant in some mysterious way?</p>
 <p class="comment">These VCAA ERDs are home-grown interpretations of Chen-style ERDs, with no industry-standard authority to them that I can find.  Even if they appear in a textbook, it's inadequate: texts are non-canon, and non-compulsory - and not always correct, come to think of it.<br />
   Asking specific questions about an arbitrary format is, I think, unfair.</p>
 <p class="comment">So... students have to decide that position W is correct because (compared to U and V) its colouring is <strong>special</strong>, so it must be a <strong>special</strong> sort of field, which means it is probably  a <strong>key field</strong>. Not sensible.</p>
 <p class="comment">Now curious about ERD formats, I noticed that the sample 2010 question had a credit to conceptdraw.com, so I went there to find what wisdom they have about <a href="http://www.conceptdraw.com/How-To-Guide/erd-symbols-and-meanings">ERD symbols and meanings</a>... there was no indication there about the meanings of shadings, but they <strong>did</strong> show various cardinality indicators which VCAA ERDs completely and sadly lack. </p>
 <p class="comment">So let's compare VCAA's sample ERD...</p>
 <p><img src="/m/ERD-sample.png" width="854" height="600" alt="VCAA ERD" /></p>
 <p class="comment">with the one from conceptdraw.com, using Chen's notation...</p>
 <p align="left"><img src="/m/ERD-conceptdraw.jpg" width="498" height="736" alt="ERD" /></p>
 <p align="left" class="comment">Nope. No special colour coding of key fields in <strong>there... </strong>key fields are <strong>underlined</strong>. They also provided a handy legend to explain the formatting conventions used, which VCAA should have done in their 2010 example. But they can't spell &quot;refers&quot;. Never mind.</p>
 <p align="left" class="comment">   So let's visit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_relationship_diagram">Wikipedia's page on ERDs</a>... where we also find that Chen-style primary key attributes are <strong>underlined</strong>, not colour coded.</p>
 <p align="left" class="comment">So I'm wondering what <strong>industry-standard source of knowledge</strong> gives VCAA the <strong>confidence</strong> to ask questions about the colour scheme of a <strong>home-made diagram type</strong> that has <strong>not been explained anywhere</strong> that I can discover in IT Applications documentation or in The Real World &#8482;?</p>

    Responses to this question most frequently covered the 24/7 access and geographic reach of the internet.<br />
    Online order forms have 24/7 access so that &lsquo;customers can order at any time&rsquo;. This increases the hours available for business, leading to the possibility of increased sales. <br />
    They can also be &lsquo;accessed immediately by people browsing&rsquo; or &lsquo;using search engines&rsquo;, which &lsquo;increases the number of locations the business can reach&rsquo; and &lsquo;leads to increased sales&rsquo;.  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><span class="myanswer">If buyers enter their own data, there is less need for data-entry effort for the organisation, so staff can either be reduced to save on wages, or the staff could be used for more profitable tasks.</span></li>

    Direct data entry is more accurate because<br />

  <p> A large game development company is creating a multi-player online game to meet the needs of online gamers. The company wants its website to have a members-only section to support its collective identity.<br />
 Select two functionality factors from those listed below.</p>
  <p align="center">    accessibility - navigation - structure - usability </p>
  <p>Explain how each would suit the needs of online gamers. [Each explanation got 2 lines of writing space.]</p>
  <p>Accessibility</p>
  <p class="myanswer">Players with disabilities, such as colour-blindness, poor muscular coordination, poor vision etc would find the site easier to use.</p>
  <p>Navigation</p>
  <p class="myanswer">Being able to go to different parts of the site with minimal confusion. clicking and page-loading will save members time and increase their visiting pleasure because they won't get lost as much or have to click as often. A simple example is having the site logo always being a link to the homepage; and having a &quot;Back to the top&quot; link at the bottom of each page.</p>
  <p>Structure</p>
  <p class="myanswer">Organising a site logically makes it easier for members to intuit where they should go to find desired resources, for example having the site divided principally by the different games on offer lets a player easily choose where to go to find information relevant to the game he/she plays.</p>
  <p>Usability</p>
  <p class="myanswer">A site that is easy to use saves the user time and frustration when seeking particular resources. For example, one site might require a click on an item to go to a download page where another click is required to start the download. Another more usable site would create a direct download link on the first page where the item appears.</p>
  <p class="comment">The word &quot;two&quot; in the instructions was not bolded, which is odd.</p>
  <p class="examiner">Average mark 1.2/2. (60%)<br />
    Many students chose navigation and accessibility as the design elements for discussion.<br />
    &#61623; Navigation: To feel comfortable in the virtual scenario, online gamers &lsquo;need to find information easily and move quickly to what they want&rsquo;.<br />
    &#61623; Accessibility: Gamers need text, audio and video modes to provide information quickly in a game situation because individuals respond differently to different media. Some get more details from audio, others from text and others from images.<br />
    &#61623; Structure: Gamers want their website organised into secured and non-secured sections so that members can privately reward and celebrate gaming achievements and build their collective identity.<br />
    &#61623; Usability: A gaming website must allow gamers to confidently, easily and accurately issue game instructions, or else they will leave.  </p></td>

  <p> A travel firm has upgraded to a new, networked, online sales system in each of its three offices.<br />
 It is considering what type of user documentation is most appropriate. Some staff want an online tutorial, but the manager believes content-sensitive help is the best option.</p>
  <p> a.	Describe how an online tutorial and content-sensitive help would each assist a staff member with using the new system.	2	marks<br />
 </p>
  <p>&bull;	online tutorial [5 lines]</p>
  <p class="myanswer">A tutorial is a self-paced, step-by-step teaching tool which explains operations and demonstrates how they are done, often providing quizzes or revision to test learning. A tutorial would help staff members who are beginners and need to learn the system from the basics.</p>
  <p>&bull;	content-sensitive help [5 lines]</p>
  <p class="myanswer">This provides information based on the user's current behaviour and status. For example if they have a picture selected, the content-sensitive help would offer help on working with pictures. This type of help is useful for trained users who need relevant help as they use the system.</p>
  <p class="examiner">Average mark 1.4/2. (70%)<br />
    Most students could describe how online tutorials would help staff who are learning to use a new online sales system. They were less able to describe how content-sensitive help would be beneficial in this scenario.<br />
    Typically, correct responses described online tutorials as providing &lsquo;step-by-step instructions on how to use all the features of the software&rsquo; and content-sensitive help as &lsquo;providing help for a particular/specific problem at the time when it is needed&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>    b.	Justify your preferred user documentation on the basis of efficiency.	3	marks [8 lines]</p>
  <p class="myanswer">There are arguments for providing <strong>both</strong> help systems; choosing between them is silly since they are meant to provide very different services. It's like asking a gardener whether she would want a shovel <strong>or</strong> a rake.<br />
    Effective tutorials will create users who are knowledgeable and skilled and who will work faster and with less effort than those who have no pre-training and must rely on the content-sensitive help alone.<br />
    The content-sensitive help would help people quickly find the help they need when they need it, thus saving time for them and saving money for the firm.<br />
    If I can only choose <strong>one</strong> form of documentation, I'd choose the tutorials, since completely untrained users would not know how to even begin, and they would be very slow, put in a lot of wasted effort and cost the firm lots of money in wages and lost sales.</p>
  <p class="comment">The key to this question is to discuss only time (speed), cost, labour, and ease of use. Anything else is effectiveness and therefore irrelevant.</p>
  <p class="comment">The very possibility that only <strong>one</strong> type of documentation is required is unrealistic.</p>
  <p class="examiner">Average mark 1.6/3. (53%)<br />
    Students who chose content-sensitive help, arguing that it is &lsquo;used only when needed&rsquo; and that users do not have to waste time working on &lsquo;features they will never need&rsquo;, received marks.<br />
    Many students chose an online tutorial as the more efficient type of documentation, arguing that by learning the &lsquo;whole package up front, users are less likely to stop for lots of little problems&rsquo;, and that having the &lsquo;big picture&rsquo; means users are more able to solve little problems themselves. These responses were awarded marks. The few students who argued coherently for other types of user documentation also received marks.  </p></td>

  <p> Harry manages a business that hires out fishing boats. The business has eight boats. Harry keeps records of the number of hours that each boat is hired. Each boat has a captain who is paid an hourly rate of $20 for a four-person boat and $30 for a six-person boat. A sample of the records and the data table that Harry keeps is shown below.<br />

  <p><strong>Boat and Captain data table</strong></p>
  <p><img src="/m/pm/13i-b7a.gif" width="547" height="127" alt="B7" /></p>

</p>
  <p><strong>Boat and Captain data table revised</strong></p>
  <p><img src="/m/pm/13i-b7b.gif" width="633" height="127" alt="B7" /></p>
  <p>a.	Normalise this data into two tables so that each non-key field is fully dependent on a key field (2NF). 4 marks [33% of a page was given for the answer]</p>
  <p class="myanswer">Just to show my working, I started with <strong>Version 1</strong>, the logical solution...</p>
  <p><img src="/m/pm/13i-B7-ERD-v2.gif" width="569" height="231" alt="ERD2" /></p>
  <p class="myanswer">Then I thought that adding the CaptainID field would be unnecessary if each boat had only one captain, so I thought of <strong>Version 2</strong>, which avoided the creation of the new CaptainID field...</p>
  <p><img src="/m/pm/13i-B7-ERD.gif" width="570" height="144" alt="Normalised table" /></p>
  <p class="myanswer">But the Captain_Table now has no single key field - the CaptainLastName+CaptainFirstName together would have to act as a key. And since the question said that &quot;each non-key field is fully dependent on <strong>a key field</strong>&quot; (not &quot;a key&quot; which could comprise more than one field) I decided to settle on <strong>Version 1</strong> after all. Maybe I was reading too much into the question?</p>
  <p class="comment">This solution assumes that each captain only has one boat, since the question says that &quot;Each boat has a captain&quot;. If not, the schema would get a lot messier!</p>
  <p class="comment">Also note that each boat only appears once in the sample data, suggesting that the &quot;Boat Hours&quot; figure is a <strong>running total</strong>, rather than the number of hours of a <strong>single voyage</strong>. This implies to me that you do not need a &quot;Voyages&quot; table to record multiple voyages and that  the total hours are just updated in that single field.</p>
  <p class="examiner">Average mark 1.6/4. (40%)<br />
    Most students could separate the data into two data tables as part of completing the second normalisation of the data table. However, many did not give titles to the new tables or create primary keys. Those students who did typically used Captain Table and Boat Table for the table names and CaptainID and BoatID for the primary keys.<br />
    Very few students addressed the problem of where the BoatHours field should be placed. Each captain&rsquo;s pay depends on data collected from the hiring transaction point being entered into this field. Those who placed the field in the Captain Table received marks. Others who correctly used design diagrams to represent two complete tables, their fields and primary keys also received marks.  </p>
  <p>b.	Explain why this process would be important to Harry's boat-hire business. [3 lines] 2 marks</p>
  <p class="myanswer">Actually, since there is a simple 1:1 relationship between boats and captains, the 2NF normalisation is actually of minimal value - actually, it's unnecessary. However, if a captain could work on several boats, the benefit would be greater since changes to boat or captain information could be done once in only one table rather than in several different places. Or if each individual booking of a boat needed to be recorded, a relational database would be needed.</p>
  <p class="myanswer">With refernce to Harry, it would be important because it would make the management and future development of his database easier, and (if it actually needed more than a 1:1 relationship) the database would be faster and smaller.</p>
  <p class="myanswer">    Normalisation is important because it</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="myanswer">groups related data to make data management tidier</li>
    <li class="myanswer">allows data to related data that could not be accessed before</li>
    <li class="myanswer">reduces data repetition</li>
    <li class="myanswer">avoids errors where data is not updated consistently in several places</li>
    <li class="myanswer"> keeps the size of the database down and speeds up data retrieval</li>
    <li class="myanswer">ensures the database can grow in future without hitting a brick wall imposed by poor early design</li>
    <li class="myanswer">allows easy reporting on single tables, such as searching/sorting/printing lists</li>
    <li class="myanswer">can prevent the accidental deletion of key data (e.g. key fields) that are needed by other tables (referential integrity)</li>

  <p><img src="/m/stamp_of_approval.jpg"  alt="Stamp of Approval" /></p>
  <p class="comment">The problem is that by making the schema so simple that it did not need a 1 to many relationship, it scuttled the value of normalisation, which was the whole point of the exercise.</p>
  <p class="examiner">Average mark 0.9/2. (45%)<br />
    Many students stated that the process of normalising one large flat file improves the accuracy of the information Harry can produce. These students received one mark. Those who completed their answer with an explanation of why this is the case received full marks. For example, &lsquo;creating two tables with primary keys reduces data redundancy&rsquo; and &lsquo;allows only a single point to update data&rsquo;. Some students explained that creating two tables with primary keys &lsquo;makes it possible to create relationships and simple queries&rsquo;. These students also received marks.  </p></td>

  <p>She  is bound by the IPA (according to the Privacy Commissioner's Office), so she has a <strong>legal</strong> responsibility not to sell student data, so <strong>there is no ethical issue</strong>.

  <p class="comment">This question causes more of a dilemma than Nancy ever faced. <br />

  <p class="myanswer">- Nancy must decide which is better: to sell student data and possibly adversely affect students' privacy; or to not sell the data and not be able to buy the sports equipment which would benefit the students.<br />

    Complete answers provided an example of the chosen design element and an explanation of how it was used to enhance the appearance of each website. For example, &lsquo;contrast is seen in design 1 with the logo &ndash; a grey tree on a white background. This catches the reader&rsquo;s eye and gives an underlying idea of what the site represents&rsquo;.<br />
    </span></p>
  <p><span class="examiner">In design 2, reverse blocking in the navigation bar (white text with black background) contrasts with the black text on white background for the remainder of the website.<br />

  <p><span class="examiner">Accepted answers for the design element of orientation included the use of either vertical (design 1) or horizontal (design 2) navigation links that complemented other design features. For consistency, students typically referred to font type and size, explaining that changes in font size appropriately matched the hierarchy of information; for example, the largest font size was allocated to the name of the organisation, with the copyright statement being in the smallest font size. </span><br />

    Students who began by stating a preferred design and identifying two design elements associated with functionality established the foundations for a good answer. For example, &lsquo;design 2 is my preferred homepage. In relation to functionality it provides better accessibility and navigation&rsquo;. Students who went on to explain how features in their preferred homepage influenced each design element received marks. For example, &lsquo;Accessibility is improved with larger and bolder links and black writing on a white background&rsquo; or &lsquo;it makes it easier for older people to read&rsquo;. Navigation is easier due to &lsquo;the consistency of the menu placement&rsquo; or &lsquo;navigation bar at the top and the logo&rsquo;.  </p></td>

    Many successful explanations of how the manager could perform the three tasks were set out under the three subheadings shown below.<br />
    <strong>Report on sales</strong><br />
    Many students explained that the manager could use a graph to report on sales trends for each fruit. Some drew graphs to represent a trend calculated from the QuantitySoldPerKg or Total columns. Others explained how a trend graph or table could be created. For example, &lsquo;calculate the QuantitySoldPerKg for apples in Jan, Feb and March and make a  graph to see if sales are going up or down&rsquo; and &lsquo;Use the Total column/field to compare the sales of each fruit for three weeks and report it in a table.&rsquo;<br />
    <strong>Identify fruits with sales greater than 500 kg</strong><br />
    Successful responses included a conditional statement or formula QuantitySoldPerKg &gt; 500. Those who chose spreadsheet software explained how this statement could be entered into the column and return a message of &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;sales above 500 kg&rsquo; or &lsquo;font colour change&rsquo; if the condition were true. Those who chose RDBMS software explained how the statement could be used in a query or filter to return a list of fruits whose sales were above 500 kg.<br />
    <strong>Test the solution</strong><br />
    Data to test the report of fruit sales typically included varying values for QuantitySoldPerKg so that the trend was altered as expected. For example, &lsquo;change the data from increasing to decreasing and see if the graph changes in the same way.&rsquo;<br />
    Data to test the fruits with sales greater than 500 kg were most commonly 499, 500 and 501. Statements such as &lsquo;below the boundary, at the boundary and above the boundary&rsquo; also received marks.</p>
  <p>    b.	Using the software that you selected in <strong>part a.</strong>, answer the following questions.</p>
  <p>    i.	Describe how the manager can identify and display on a web page the cheapest fruit    available.	2	marks [5 lines]</p>
  <p class="comment">&quot;display on a web page&quot;? Do the examiners want students to come out with something as trite as &quot;Open a web page editor, create or load the web page, type in the number, save the page and upload it with FTP&quot;? That really would be a waste of a year of study.</p>
  <p class="comment">Or do the examiners expect student to explain how to extract the data from a spreadsheet or database, feed it into a webpage with PHP, SQL, Cold Fusion or whatever and display it? I'll be spanked with a saucy sausage dog if I could explain how to do it.</p>
  <p class="comment">Either way, the answer will either be trivially simple, or monstrously difficult.<br />
    I think the examiners need to go and sit on the naughty step and think about what they've done. </p>
  <p class="comment"><img src="/m/schmacho.jpg" alt="" width="98" height="150" /></p>
  <p class="comment">To identify the cheapest fruit is a different  matter, but not much easier if you think about it. <br />
    To find the mininum <strong>price</strong> is easy with the MIN( ) function, but the question asks for the &quot;cheapest fruit&quot; (i.e. its name) fruit to be displayed. This is <strong>very</strong> hard to do in Excel. <br />
    Refer to the ITA paper for <a href="/p/postmortem-2008i.htm#Q12">2008 question B12e</a> which asked a similar question. The answer then would have to have been<br />
    <span class="myanswer">=&quot;The biggest sales were for &quot; &amp; INDEX( A2:C12 , MATCH( MAX( C2:C12 ) , C2:C12 , 0 ) , 1 ) &amp; &quot; which sold &quot; &amp; MAX( C2:C12 ) </span></p>
  <hr />
  <p class="comment">FEEDBACK</p>
  <p class="comment">Laurie suggested using VLOOKUP, which was a good idea. This would work...<br />
    =VLOOKUP( MIN(C2:C5) ,&nbsp;price_table , name_column, FALSE )&nbsp;<br />
    But you'd need the prices in the first column of the table, and you need FALSE for the range lookup if the fruits are sorted by name rather than by price. I wonder how many kids would be capable of such a formula, however.</p>
  <p class="comment">Roland suggested GoogleDocs spreadsheet with the security pegged at a public view setting for putting the value on a web page.</p>
  <hr />
  <p class="black">SPREADSHEET</p>
  <p class="comment">The dumbest, but probably expected answer is: </p>
  <p class="myanswer">The manager should:<br />
    - 
put the formula =MIN(C2:C5) in the cell where the minimum price should be shown.<br />
- look at the answer <strong>very carefully</strong> with his/her eyes, open a web page editor such as Adobe Dreamweaver, create or load the webpage in question, type the value into the page using a QWERTY keyboard and managerial fingers, carefully save the page, and upload the HTML file to the web server using FTP.</p>
  <p class="comment">Is that really what the examiners were after? Or did they want something like...</p>
  <p class="myanswer">- Sort the fruits in acending order by the PricePerKg column so the cheapest fruit appears at the top. <br />
    - Look at the answer very carefully... (etc)</p>
  <p class="comment">I only hope they accept variations of answers for their vague and impossible question.</p>

  <p class="examiner">Average mark 0.9/2. (45%)<br />
    To gain full marks students had to clearly state the technique for identifying the cheapest fruit as well as a way of presenting this information on a web page. Accepted answers included sorting the price per kg column or field from lowest to highest (technique) and either displaying the cheapest fruit name in a text box or bolding it.</p>
  <p>    ii.	Recommend a format or convention that the manager could apply when displaying the    cheapest fruit to the user.	2 marks [5 lines]</p>
  <p class="myanswer">Use a leading dollar sign, then the price with 2 decimal places. <br />
    O, and use comma separators to separate the thousands if the cheapest fruit is over $999.99.</p>
  <p class="comment">Really - they gave 5 lines of writing for that? What else could one say? Black Arial 12 point?  </p>
  <p class="examiner">Average mark 1/2. (50%)<br />
    There is still some confusion regarding the difference between a format and a convention. A convention is a generally acceptable rule governing the layout or presentation of a format &ndash; for example, a receipt has a date; however, the way in which the date is presented or arranged is a formatting decision. There are a variety of date formats such as 28 February 2013; February 28, 2013; 28/02/13; 28-02-2013.<br />
    Examples of accepted formats and conventions included a title (convention) or the title being in bold or in all capitals (format) or a title (convention) with an image (format) of the cheapest fruit.</p></td>

  <p> Kelly is a writer who keeps a data table of the images that she uses in each of the 12 chapters of her new book. The table has the following field names.</p>
  <p align="center"> FileName, Chapter, FileFormat, Description, FileSize<br />

 Chapter7<br />
 Chapter8<br />
 Chapter9</p>
  <p> a.	Explain why this happens.	2	marks [3 lines]</p>
  <p class="blue">Because she has defined the Chapter field as being of type TEXT, the chapter names are being sorted purely as text with no recognition of the value of the position of the numerical digits. In that way, &quot;12&quot; comes before &quot;2&quot; because the digit 1 is alphabetically before the digit &quot;2&quot;.</p>

  <p class="examiner">Average mark 1/2. (50%)<br />
    Many students explained that the data type was text and as such 10, 11 and 12 &lsquo;have no place value&rsquo;. This means only the &lsquo;1 is compared to 2, 3 and 4&rsquo;. These students received full marks. Others who stated that the problem arose because the numbers were sorted as text received one mark.</p>
  <p>    b.	Recommend a procedure that Kelly could follow to ensure chapters are displayed in the correct numerical order. Explain how she could test the procedure.	3	marks [6 lines]</p>
  <p class="myanswer">Fixing: Insert leading zeroes as place-holders, such as Chapter01.<br />
    Testing: After inserting the leading zeroes, sort the chapters again by the Chapter field and check that they are now in the correct order.</p>
  <p class="comment">Notice how the question had two parts to it and my answer was very clearly divided into two parts as well. Don't mix one answer up in another as a large amorphous blob and give the impression you can't tell the difference between them.</p>

    Many students suggested that Kelly remove the word &lsquo;Chapter&rsquo; from the list and use it as a heading or label. She could then &lsquo;change the data type to number and sort the list&rsquo;.<br />
    Other students suggested Kelly add a leading or spacing zero or format mask so that all the &lsquo;number&rsquo; parts of the data have the same number of characters; for example, &lsquo;Chapter01, Chapter02, etc&rsquo;. Then when Kelly sorted the text data, &lsquo;Chapter02 is less than Chapter11&rsquo;.<br />

<td width="100%" height="84"><p class="myanswer"><em>Overall - </em><span class="comment">some unfair and unclear questions, in my opinion. My self-appointed Board of Review recommends:</span></p>
  <ul>
    <li class="comment">A1 - if a key knowledge dotpoint says &quot;including A,B and C&quot; and there is a question about that dotpoint, do <strong>not</strong> include 'incorrect' options that are in fact <strong>true </strong>and <strong>accurate</strong>, but are not A, B or C. The word &quot;including&quot; means that A, B and C must be taught, not that only A, B and C exist. </li>
    <li class="comment">the official ERD format (A19, A20) needs to be formalised according to the conventions of <em>The Real World</em> &#8482;. There should be no more home-baked standards that noone else uses. Students are supposed to be able to interpret these 'standards' with nothing more than one sample question in 2010. If the ERD was meant to be of Chen style, do it <strong>properly</strong>, with underlined key field names in attributes. It is no harder for students to learn, and actually reflects what real people do in the industry.</li>
    <li class="comment">The 'Cheapest Fruit' question (B10) was a mess. Achieving the goal properly (showing the name of the cheapest fruit) would be effectively impossible for secondary students. Showing it on a web page would either be trivially inane (typing it in) or basically impossible (using code to extract the value and insert it into dynamic HTML.)</li>
    <li class="comment">The legislation question involving a school (B8) was also nasty. It is not at all clear (to me at least) whether a school falls under the IPA. If it does, there is <strong>no moral dilemma</strong> as claimed by B8c because the administrator's planned actions would be illegal rather than immoral. <br />
      Since question B8c insists that there <strong>is</strong> a moral dilemma, it follows that Nancy has freedom of choice because there are no legal impediments, so the answer to B8a must be &quot;No law applies.&quot; Very messy indeed. <br />
      B8c should not have insisted that there was a moral dilemma. Students should have been asked whether there were a moral dilemma or not, and if so what it was. In this way if a student believed that schools were <strong>not</strong> subject to the IPA and said &quot;No law applies&quot; to B8a, he/she could then roll out the moral dilemma consequence in B8c.<br />
      Recommendation: organisations
      used in Privacy legislation questions should have their nature very clearly obvious to students who lack a degree in law. i.e. stick to the classic categories, e.g. a private org turning over &gt; $3m, any org holding health info.</li>
    <li class="comment">The other legislation question (A18) about what is &quot;reasonable&quot; when disposing of computers is also, I think, unfair for a section A question. It requires an argument because the answer is really a judgement call, an opinion based on known ITA facts. Students could argue that simply deleting files might be reasonable in this case because the chance of primary school kids undeleting files and misusing data is minuscule. Others could argue that stricter deletion protocols are reasonable. The problem that in Section A, there is no way for students to make such arguments in support of their answers.<br />
      Recommendation:
      Section A questions should contain only issues that are a matter of fact rather than of opinion and judgement, which should be in section B where students can justify their answers.</li>
    <li class="comment">The information in A6 about where the login/password information goes was unclear. What does &quot;login and password&quot; &quot;information&quot; actually refer to? Is it the actual list of login names and passwords that the wording implies? Or does it refer to login and password <strong>facilities</strong> used when logging in? The distinction between the two materially affects the choice of answer. Such ambiguity is an unfair burden on students who are trying to show their understanding of ITA.</li>
    <li class="comment">Way too many marks went to peripheral issues like sorting text, and design elements. The weight of websites was also overpowering.</li>

    <p>For the first time ever in an IT Post Mortem, I did a rough survey of where the marks went in terms of key knowledge. <br />
      The topic was assigned according to the <strong>real</strong> main focus of a question, so while A17 was talking about security issues, it needed to be answered with  knowledge of efficiency/effectiveness and required no understanding of security at all.</p>

  <td height="84"><h2><a name="feedback" id="feedback"></a>Student Feedback</h2>
    <p>Hu - I'm a Year 12 student who completed the ITA exam a few days back, and......kind of annoyed with it, to be honest. I'm not sure what the official makeup of the exam is meant to be, but we were taught about different types of cabling, what routers and network cards do, what type of network was best for a certain business (bus, star, etc.). I just find it strange that there was nothing on the exam relating to what we were taught in the first term of Year 12 in ITA. </p></td>
