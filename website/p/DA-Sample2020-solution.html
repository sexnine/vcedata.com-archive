          </blockquote>
          <p>The question's link lines between fields in tables was very wonky (e.g. in option D, the Dentist line is halfway between the first and second fields). <em>Bad</em> examiner.</p>
          <p>The question's premise of a transition of data from a flat-file spreadsheet to a relational database was clever. It was a real-world way to force the separation of the data into related tables and create relationships. Jolly good.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p class="comment">BTW, it is unspoken by the examiners, but we are assume to assume the the <u>underlined fields</u> in these tables are key fields. I expect the examiners thought (a) that students who knew what key fields were would know this, and (b) students who <em>didn't</em> know this would probably be going &quot;eeny meeny miney mo&quot; to select the answer anyway.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>But why are <em>AppointmentDate</em> and <em>AppointmentTime</em> also underlined? Are they also keys to fields in tables that don't exist?</p>
          <p>Or are the 3 underlined fields meant to be the APPOINTMENT table's key?</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p class="comment">Professional database engineers NEVER EVER use multiple fields in a key. It's a cardinal sin, made by newbies on day one and beaten out of them with blunt instruments before morning tea. EVERY table has its own key field - even if you never end up using it. It's a habit that <em>real</em> database engineers cannot and should not break when creating a table: (1) create the table, (2) create an ID field. It's like: put on left sock, put on right sock. It does not even bear thinking about. JUST DO IT.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Using multiple fields for a table key is the ONLY way to violate third normal form (<strong>3NF</strong> - just get used to it). NEVER use multiple fields for a key. You have been warned.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p class="comment">Yet, the examiners still like to assume that incompetent morons put on one sock and forget the other one, and create tables without unique key fields - and then insist on asking exam questions about how to fix the problem. <strong>3NF IS NOT A PROBLEM</strong>, any more than leaving home wearing only one sock is a problem. 3NF failure is a sign of incompetence. You don't fix the problem - you fire the database designer who created the problem. Grrr. Examiners take note.</p>
            <p class="comment">Sorry. 3NF gets me riled. Where were we?</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><strong>A</strong>. All data relating to a dentist is in the dentist table - the same for appointments and patients. This is as it should be for <strong>3NF</strong>. The relationships (lines between tables) correctly link the Dentist ID between tables 1 and 2.</p>
          <p><strong>B.</strong> Dentist number in table 1 seems to be linked halfway in table 2 between Dentist Number and AppointmentDate. Which is weird. It's either sloppy formatting, or it's assuming that the 3 underlined fields in the Appointment table form its key. The Patient number relationship line is also wonky. I just left this option hanging until I looked at the others.</p>
          <p><strong>C.</strong> Can be thrown out of consideration immediately. PatientName in the Appointment table would never be related to separate name fields in the Patient Table.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p class="comment">Sometimes it's easier to throw out silly options, then go back and reconsider those that remain.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><strong>D.</strong> You might at first wonder: options A and D are the same! The vital relationships are the same. What's going on? Then, comparing A and D more closely, you see &quot;Estimated Duration&quot; in the Patient table. Either it is the estimated duration of the appointment (in which case it should appear in the Appointment table to satisfy 2NF) - or each patient has an Estimated Duration and will die if they exceed it. </p>
          <p>This is probably true, but not really relevant to a dentist's booking database. So let's cross out option D.</p>
          <p>That leaves <strong>A</strong>. Job done.        </p>

          <p>I was thinking C because an existence check would indeed ensure a postcode had been entered, but the question says &quot;a <em>valid</em> postcode has been entered&quot;. That's a different thing. In section A be sure to read and consider all the words in a question. They can be subtle and tricksy if you make rash decisions.</p>

        <td align="center" valign="top" class="left"><p>Answer is <strong>A</strong></p>
          <p>A tricky one.
            Remember that when given a list of items in an option, <em>all</em> of the items need to be true for the option to be true. Rule just one out, and you can rule out that option as an answer.</p>
          <p>Also remember that the question asks for the <strong>most</strong> appropriate list. Not just <strong>any</strong> appropriate list. That makes a big difference in the world of Section A.</p>
          <p>Here's how the thinking process could go:</p>
          <p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Make a mental note</strong> of what you are looking for: criterion for data <strong>integrity</strong>. That is the main point to focus on. Data integrity refers to its trustworthiness, quality, reliability, completeness, currency (up-to-dateness) etc. </p>
          <p>Even better, pull out the<span class="yellowback"> highlighter</span> (that you really should have brought with you) and <span class="yellowback">highlight</span> that key word so you don't forget its importance it 30 seconds later. </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><span class="comment">Remember the exam rules</span>: <span class="courier">Students are permitted to bring into the examination room: pens, pencils, <strong class="yellowback">highlighters</strong>, erasers,  sharpeners and rulers.</span></p>
            <p class="comment"><strong>AT THIS POINT</strong> - I introduce a useful Section A technique. Beside each ABCD option that you consider, put a tick (&quot;could be right&quot;), a cross (&quot;can't be right&quot;) or a question mark (&quot;not sure&quot;). This can help you make your final decision. Please avoid the alternative technique of yelling out, &quot;Yep!&quot; / &quot;No way!&quot; / &quot;Dunno about that&quot; in the exam room.</p>

          <p><strong>2. Look at Option A</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Timeliness? Yep. That's a requirement for data integrity. Give it a tick. </li>
            <li>Authenticity (Is data real/genuine? Is it actually from the source from which it claims to come?) Tick.</li>
            <li>Correctness? (Does it have any errors at all?) If data is just <em>wrong</em>, it lacks integrity, e.g. most cats have five legs*, Nicolas Cage is a fine actor. Tick.</li>
            <li>Accuracy? (How closely does the data represent reality?) Inaccurate data becomes untrustworthy and thereby loses integrity, so tick.</li>
          </ul>
          <blockquote>
            <p class="comment"><em>A philosophical and etymological sidebar:</em> <strong>Correct vs accurate?</strong> These terms are similar, but not identical. You could say &quot;I arrived around 9am&quot; and it would be correct, but not so accurate. You could have said &quot;I arrived at 9:01 and 2.4 seconds a.m.&quot; which would be both correct and accurate. But you can't be accurate but incorrect: &quot;Today I landed on the planet Fribulon Minor at 9:01 and 2.4 seconds a.m.&quot; So you can be correct but inaccurate, but you can't be incorrect and accurate.</p>

          <p>Option A survives vetting - give it a provisional tick of approval.<img src="/bits/mark-tick.png" width="30" height="28" alt="tick
"/></p>
          <blockquote>
            <p class="comment"><em>But</em> - and this is a <strong>big</strong> but in Section A - always consider <em>every</em> option in a question. Don't find an answer that is &quot;true&quot;, select it and move on to the next question. It could well be that one of the other unconsidered options is even <strong>more</strong> correct. This does happen in VCAA exams. Trying to save time by ignoring options is a foolish move.          </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><strong>2. Look at Option B</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>timeliness - We already decided this is valid, so tick.</li>
            <li>accountability - Wait. What? I haven't seen this one. Did my teacher and the textbook leave it out? It <em>does</em> sound impressive, though. Maybe it's possible. I'll question-mark it.</li>
            <li> relevance - Yes. Data that is irrelevant to an issue has no value at all, and may in fact be deceptive.</li>
            <li> accuracy - Already ticked.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>So - we have 3 ticks and a question mark. Not looking good. Overall - <img src="/bits/mark-q.png" width="20" height="30" alt=""></p>

Section A options sometimes uses terms designed to make such people think, &quot;Oooh, that sounds brainy!

            <li>reasonableness - whoa. This is new. You have a vague memory about how validation checks the <em>reasonableness</em> of data. It sort of makes sense that it would be also related to data integrity. OK. We'll question-mark that one.</li>
            <li>referencing - Well, yeah. You did have to reference sources using the APA style, but is that relevant to data integrity? Not really. Actually,<strong> not at all.</strong> Rule it out.</li>

          <p><strong>It's a Dog's Breakfast&trade;</strong></p>
          <p>This question is fatally flawed. Yet it is a valuable learning experience for you. Let's look at it in detail.</p>
          <p><strong>Investigate the stem</strong> - key words: <span class="yellowback">query</span>, <span class="yellowback">relational</span>. Highlight them.</p>
          <p>A <em>query</em> is user's specification for the retrieval of relevant data from the database. </p>
          <p><em>Relational</em> means the database has two or more related tables.</p>
          <p>But you knew that. Let's examine the options:</p>
          <p><strong>Option A</strong> - nope. That would be a <em>report</em>, not a form. A form is for data input, not output.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p class="comment"><em>Annoyed Note </em>- the exam <em>should</em> be free of terms or concepts related to a specific software tool, like <em>Microsoft Access, </em>or<em> Excel</em>. In reality, get used to the fact that the examiners will usually be thinking of MS products when they ask questions. Users of other RDBMS, such as Filemaker, need to learn and recognise terms like query, report etc, and ignore the &quot;rule&quot; that calculated fields don't exist.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p><strong>Option B</strong> - sounds reasonable. Queries usually provide totals, averages, statistical summaries.</p>
          <p>Option C - Data <em>may</em> be sorted, but not necessarily in <em>alphabetical</em> order.</p>
          <p>Option D - This is the problematic official answer. A query <em>does</em> extract data from tables. No argument there. But a query does <strong>not</strong> have to extract data from two or more tables. And we're being careful to consider <em>all</em> of the words in a stem and an option.</p>
          <p>And, before you start... Yes! I <em>know</em> you highlighted the word <span class="yellowback">relational</span> in the stem.</p>
          <p>But just because the database is relational (with two or more tables) <strong>does not mean</strong> that a query in that database <strong>must</strong> <strong>use</strong> two or more of those tables! </p>
          <p>A query in a relational database is quite entitled to extract data from <strong>a single table</strong> from the relational database.</p>
          <p>The premise of the question is just <strong class="red">WRONG</strong>.</p>
          <p>OK. Let's calm down. </p>
          <p>You're in an exam. </p>
          <p>You've seen the problem. </p>
          <p>You can't fire off an angry email to VCAA. </p>
          <p><strong>What do you do in a case like this?</strong></p>
          <p>1. Remember that <strong>you must provide an answer</strong> to get any chance of earning a mark. No answer automatically means no mark, even if the question is flawed. It has happened <em>more than once</em> that a question has been challenged, judged to be officially wrong, and every student who gave any answer earned a mark.</p>
          <p>2. Suck down your righteous indignation and calmly ask yourself: OK. The question is as stupid as Justin Bieber. But <strong>what were the examiners probably thinking</strong>? What were they <em>expecting</em> to be the right answer?</p>
          <p>You know it won't be A or C. Forget them.</p>
          <p>B is certainly possible. That is what I originally opted for. </p>
          <p>D  is right, apart from the &quot;two or more&quot; stuff.</p>
          <p>Toss a coin? Hope for the best? </p>
          <p>Do your best, and pray that someone will officially complain to VCAA and have the question stricken and any answer rewarded.          </p>

That is why the options break them down into separate database fields, e.g. &quot;Melbourne 13425km&quot; is split into discrete fields <em>BeginLocation</em> (Melbourne) and <em>Begin (13425)</em>. So, that's a good thing.</p>

            <li><span class="yellowback">field names</span> = the actual choice of <strong>names</strong> (e.g. &quot;Litres&quot; vs &quot;L&quot;) and  not data <strong>topics</strong></li>
            <li><span class="yellowback">efficient</span> = Saving time, money, labour (as opposed to ease of use, accuracy, attractiveness of output, etc)</li>

          <blockquote>
            <p class="comment">Let's also note an important omission in the stem. &quot;efficient use of the database&quot; - by <em>whom</em>? The developer or the end-user? Logically (and ideally), the <strong>end-user will never see the field names</strong> used by the developer. End users may see <strong>captions</strong> used in reports, but the actual field <em>names</em> are only known and used by the database <em>developers</em>. So, we can only assume that the question must refer to the efficient use of the database by its <em>developer</em>. This may be important later.</p>

          <p>Let's walk through it. You might want to put on gumboots. It might get sticky and smelly....</p>
          <p><strong>Option A</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li> <strong class="code">Fuel</strong> - could be ambiguous. It might refer to fuel <em>consumption</em> or fuel <em>type</em>. Options B and D fix that problem, but is it an <em>efficiency</em> issue? Nope. It's <em>effectiveness</em>, relating to accuracy (the potential for developers to make errors by misinterpreting the field name). But it's shorter and takes less effort to type that &quot;FuelType&quot; so it's more <span class="yellowback">efficient</span>.<span class="blue"> Summary: good choice.</span></li>
            <li><strong class="code">L</strong> - &quot;L&quot; is not immediately obvious as referring to &quot;Litres Used&quot; so errors could occur if developers misunderstand its meaning and refer to the wrong field (as with &quot;Fuel&quot; above. But, again, this is not an <em>efficiency</em> issue, as demanded by the question's stem. In fact, using the name <span class="code">L</span> is <strong>more</strong> efficient for developers because it involves less typing (so its faster and takes less labour). <span class="blue"> Summary: good choice.</span></li>
            <li><strong class="code">Distance</strong> -  interesting! This field is completely unnecessary since it can be dynamically generated in a Filemaker calculated field or a report in Access. Typing the distance into a table is a waste of time and effort and is definitely NOT efficient. <span class="red"> Summary: bad choice</span>.</li>
            <li><strong class="code">Begin</strong> - Again, two options are provided: &quot;Begin&quot; and &quot;BeginLocation&quot; and again one is less ambiguous, but the other takes less typing. Since the stem is concerned with <span class="yellowback">efficiency</span>, you'd really have to go for the shorter option as used here and in &lt;B&gt;? <span class="blue"> Summary: good choice.</span></li>
            <li><strong class="code">End</strong> - See <em>Begin</em> above. <span class="blue"> Summary: good choice.</span></li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Option B</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong class="code">FuelType</strong> - see <em>Fuel</em> in &lt;A&gt;. Less <span class="yellowback">efficient</span> because of more effort typing.<span class="red"> Summary: bad choice</span>.</li>
            <li><strong class="code">Litres</strong> - see L in &lt;A&gt;. Less <span class="yellowback">efficient</span> because of more effort typing.<span class="red"> Summary: bad choice</span></li>

          </ul>
          <p><strong>Option C</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li> <strong class="code">Type</strong> - Ambiguous (could refer to vehicle type or fuel type), but it's shorter than &quot;FuelType&quot;.  <span class="blue"> Summary: good choice.</span></li>

          <blockquote>
            <p class="comment">The names are certainly praiseworthy, but not for their efficiency.

          <p>Let's go through the options again, to show the decision process.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Option A.</strong> Again, you notice that in each option there are multiple items connected by &quot;and&quot;. <em>Both</em> options need to be true for the option to be acceptable. You'd think that career advice would need to be age appropriate. And gender inclusivity is a big thing for the sheilas, so why not keep them happy and let's tick that too. [This Is A Joke]. So, big tick for option A.</li>
            <li><strong>Option B.</strong> Appropriate for <strong>all</strong> ages? We're not expecting tiny tots or many old-age pensioners to be entering careers, so this is out. Gender <strong>ex</strong>clusive? Read carefully! Rule out B.</li>
            <li><strong>Option C.</strong> Suitable for adults only? No, many teens would be in the target audience. Culturally <strong>ex</strong>clusive? Again, that in itself would immediately rule out option C.</li>
            <li><strong>Option D.</strong> Suitable for young people only? No, many adults would be thinking of changing careers or entering new careers. Culturally inclusive is fine though. Rule out D.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>So, the choice is clear, if you read the options carefully.</p>

          <p>This requires some finer decision-making. All of the options are relevant to data integrity, but which is the <em>most</em> important?</p>
          <p>Data could be a <em>little</em> inaccurate but still have value. It's a matter of degree. Also, data could be a little out of date but still have value. Data could probably tolerate being a <em>tiny</em> bit unreasonable - but not a lot. </p>

          <li>Feel free to <span class="yellowback">jot down your answer's key ideas</span> and terms, or do rough sketches of pictorial answers in the margins or the blank pages in the answer book.</li>
          <li><span class="yellowback">Write legibly</span>. If your normal writing looks like it is done by a drunk death-metal drummer having a seizure, write in CAPITALS or p-r-i-n-t. It takes longer, but at least it's readable. The exam markers will do their best to translate your scrawled hieroglyphics, but they are not miracle workers.</li>

          <p >The two parts of B1 [exam section <strong>B</strong> question <strong>1</strong>] are worth 3 marks. Assume that naming the technique gets 1 and the description gets 2 marks. I don't think VCAA works with half marks when assessing answers.</p>

            It should just say:<em>&quot;Nikita is studying meteorology at university. She is asked to research and analyse weather patterns in order to predict the weather for the coming summer months&quot;.</em>&nbsp; <br>
            Don't you think?</p>
          <p><strong>Description:</strong> (3 lines provided)</p>
          <p >My knee-jerk answer (without further research into BOM offerings):</p>
          <blockquote>
             <p class="myanswer">Nikita should download the BOM data, import it into a spreadsheet, create line graphs of past temperature, rain, wind (etc) data. She could then  extrapolate (extend) the lines into the future to make predictions.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p  >It is unclear whether the question wants Nikita to&nbsp;just <strong>analyse</strong> past weather patterns, or actually make <strong>predictions</strong>. Exam case studies often lack important details. When in doubt,&nbsp;explain your assumptions. e.g. &quot;If Nikita is expected to make predictions, she should...&quot;. You might at least get partial marks.</p>
        <p >Rationale for my answer:</p>
        <ul>
           <li >it fits in the space allotted for a hand-written answer on the exam paper.</li>
           <li >it is feasible: spreadsheets <strong>can</strong> do that. And spreadsheets are commonplace.</li>
           <li >it does not rely on very vague or extreme/inappropriate solutions (e.g. &quot;She should use artificial intelligence to predict...&quot;)</li>
           <li >it describes the process she could use to use the data for her research.</li>
           <li >it uses IT terms correctly,&nbsp;such as <strong>download</strong> and <strong>import</strong>. 
              <ul>
                 <li>Sloppy use of IT expressions will hurt you. Want to look like an idiot? Use a term you don't actually understand. It gives the markers a well-earned laugh; it gives you get zero&nbsp;marks.</li>
              </ul>
           </li>
           <li >it explained a term (extrapolate) to show I wasn't just quoting a term parrot-fashion, and that I knew what the term actually meant. Lazy students often (TOO OFTEN) use buzzwords and technical jargon they don't understand, hoping to sound like they know of what they speak... they rarely do. 
              <ul>
                 <li>To explain: <strong>extrapolate</strong> means to go beyond known data, such as following the trend of a graph line into the future. </li>
                 <li>Compare with <strong>interpolate </strong>which is to invent data that will logically fill in the gaps where data is missing between known data points.</li>

        <td align="center" class="left"><p>Let's look at the question's instructions in detail...</p>
           <blockquote>
              <p class="question">Describe the two validation checks that could be done on the student results for running times, as listed below, and provide an example for each.</p>
           </blockquote>
           <p>1. Note the verb: <strong>describe</strong>. This means you need to&nbsp;say what something is like.</p>
           <p>2. Highlight the words <span class="yellowback"><strong>validation checks</strong></span> - this is a MAJOR criterion. It's not &quot;testing&quot; or &quot;evaluation&quot;.              Like Pavlov's dog, you should start salivating when you see IT exam words like this. 
            If you misread a key&nbsp;word in&nbsp;a question, everything you write may be worthless.</p>
           <p>3. <strong>and</strong> - such a small word is so important when reading questions. It means you have to do more than one thing. <br>
            Its natural enemy in the wild is the word <strong>or</strong>. Learn to tell them apart.</p>
           <p>4. <strong>an example - </strong>&quot;an&quot; means <strong>one</strong>. Not <em>two</em>. If you give two great examples, you'll only get marks for <strong>one</strong>. </p>
           <ul>
              <li>If you give an irrelevant load of trash first, and then give a <em>perfect </em>example, it just looks like you <em>couldn't tell the difference</em> between what was right and what was ridiculous.</li>
              <li>Don't expect the marker to choose which answer to assess: it will probably be your <strong>first</strong> (rubbish) answer. </li>
              <li>If you put down a dumb answer, then realise your error and devise your perfect replacement answer, <span class="crossedout">cross out the wrong one!</span></li>
              <li>Your entire goal in the exam is to demonstrate your knowledge of the subject. If you leave the marker in doubt, you will suffer.</li>
           </ul>
           <p>Get an overview of the structure of the question.</p>
           <ul>
              <li>Four marks in total               </li>
              <li>Two major parts - <em>description</em> of range check and type check (3 lines each) <strong>+</strong> 1 line for an <em>example</em></li>
              <li>Usually, one line of writing is worth 1 mark. In this case, however, it seems the descriptions and examples are worth the same.<span class="comment">&nbsp;Hmmm.</span></li>
            </ul>
           <p>As usual, think though&nbsp;what knowledge the question wants you to demonstrate, and what your first words should be. </p>
           <p>Remember, <strong>all</strong> of your marks come from this thinking. The <em>writing</em> is only evidence of that thought. Writing without thought is a complete waste of time, ink and oxygen.           </p>

           <p><strong>RANGE CHECK</strong></p>
           <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
           <p class="myanswer">Checks that the data lies within reasonable or allowable limits, or exists in a list of permitted/acceptable options.</p>
           <blockquote>
              <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
           </blockquote>
           <ol>
              <li>I didn't start the answer with &quot;A range check checks that..&quot;&nbsp;The exam paper already provided the heading so you don't need to waste time and words repeating it. The marker can already see the topic - <em>your</em> job is to answer it.</li>
              <li> &quot;Reasonable&quot; and &quot;allowable&quot; are two different things, so I mentioned them both. I could&nbsp;have used &quot;parameters&quot; instead of &quot;limits&quot;, but you should only use the fancy tech talk if you're confident that you really understand what it means. Don't try to impress with big words: as mentioned elsewhere on this site, showing off usually backfires.</li>
              <li> The bit after &quot;or&quot; is not really relevant in this case study - the running times are not items from a limited list. But it <strong>is</strong> relevant to describing a range check, so I put it in just to be safe. When given a case study, your answer should be relevant to the case given, and not apply to <em>any</em> old situation you could think of.</li>
           </ol>
           <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
           <p class="myanswer">Times must be &gt; zero.</p>

                 <li>Get your facts right. Make sure your answer is relevant to the question.</li>

I assumed the marker - an IT teacher - would  know what I mean, but only if I used the symbols correctly.

           <ol>
              <li>If I'd said &quot;Checks whether data is of an appropriate data type&quot;, I would have been 100% correct  BUT it would just have <em>repeated the question</em> without showing that I actually knew what a &quot;data type&quot; was. Never simply repeat the question and expect full marks. Just to be sure, I added a little clarification. It was only a word or two but it nailed the fact that I was <em>not</em> guessing.&nbsp;</li>
              <li>This raises an interesting issue because some people (not intelligent people) <em>could</em> store running times in the format &quot;&quot;HH<strong>:</strong>MM<strong>:</strong>SS&quot; (e.g. 1:23:45.6) for 1 hour, 23 minutes, 45.6 seconds. But such data would be unintelligible to a database, and would violate first normal form (1NF) because it combined 3 fields of data in one. The type check could weed out those unintelligent people's data by finding the tell-tale colons in the field.</li>
            </ol>
           <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
         <p class="myanswer">Checking the value only contains valid number characters (0-9 and <strong>.</strong>)</p>
         <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Again, note the brief demonstration (in parentheses) that I knew what I was talking about, and not just spouting jargon that I'd heard during the year but never really understood. In your exam answers, you need to distinguish yourself from your lazy classmates who never paid attention in class or understood the details of the theory. Look upon the exam like a <em>job interview</em> - you're trying to <em>impress</em>.         </p>

        <td align="center" valign="top" class="left"><p>For <strong>2</strong> marks, you need to <span class="yellowback"><strong>outline</strong> <strong>two</strong> <strong>functions</strong></span> to <strong><span class="yellowback">manipulate</span></strong> the data in the spreadsheet.</p>
           <p>&quot;Manipulation&quot; == &quot;processing&quot;, so we're looking at tools in&nbsp;the spreadsheet that can transform raw data into other forms, such as statistics (totals, averages, counts etc), charts, graphs, formatted text. etc</p>
           <p>Fortunately, all spreadsheets follow the example of the legendary Lotus 1-2-3 (1983), which was copied by Microsoft for Excel, and cloned by LibreOffice, OpenOffice and <em>everyone</em> else. If anyone created a spreadsheet that was completely different, they would probably be tarred, feathered, and run out of town. So feel free to use MS Excel function names and syntax for your answers. You'd look weird if you didn't.</p>
           <p>(The 'tarring and feathering' stuff was for my U.S. readers - whom I cannot explain, but seem to be multitudinous for no particular reason.)</p>
           <p>Let's see what the question wants us to do...   </p>
           <p>OUTLINE = provide a brief overall description. For two marks, don't&nbsp;write an essay.</p>
           <p>Let's start with the bleeding obvious. </p>
           <p>(Note: sometimes, the bleeding obvious is <em>exactly</em> what the marker expects you to say. Trying to be quirky and different will probably only lose you marks.)</p>
           <p>We are given no clues as to what manipulation / processing is being done, so ANY reasonable ones will do. So that's easy...</p>
           <p>NOTE - you don't have to worry about the <em>exact</em> names of spreadsheet functions since VCAA does <strong>not</strong> mandate specific brands or versions of software tools - and different software tools' details may vary. </p>
           <p>But make your meaning clear, e.g. referring to a function AV( ) is not as clear as calling it AVERAGE( ) - and remember that <span class="red">your primary mission in the exam is to demonstrate your knowledge</span>.</p>
           <p>OK. Think of TWO RELEVANT SPREADSHEET functions. Five spring to mind...</p>
           <p>1. AVERAGE</p>
           <p>2. TOTAL</p>
           <p>3. SORT</p>
           <p>4. PRODUCE A GRAPH</p>
           <p>5. FILTER</p>
           <p>Avoid things like <strong>formatting</strong> (bold, centre, number of decimal places etc) since that's not <em>manipulating</em> data, it's just changing the <em>appearance</em> of the displayed data..</p>
           <p>OK. Our initial brainstorm came up with five possible responses. For most thoughtful folk, their first answers are usually the most relevant, but give them a good look to double-check that they are actually relevant to the question.</p>
           <blockquote>
              <p>TIP: Every so often, look back at the original question to make sure you haven't drifted off-topic and are now answering a question you <strong>wish</strong> you'd been asked.</p>
         </blockquote>
           <p>When you are asked for X answers and can think of X+34 answers, you need to <em>prune</em>.&nbsp; Be ruthless. Be brave enough to promote some options and demote other less-likely ones. If in doubt, demote. Keep the dead-certs. Keep your best options - throw the rest into the howling blizzard of Antarctic penguin-scented deselection. I hope I am clear.</p>
           <p>So - I'll stick with my original two responses, as banal and unoriginal as they are. They are relevant, and you are not being marked on your originality: <strong>you are being marked on your answer's appropriateness to the question</strong>.</p>
           <p>So</p>
           <p><strong>Function 1</strong> (3 lines, 1 mark out of 2 - so keep it short)</p>
           <p class="myanswer">AVERAGE - Elias would get an average of the data.</p>
           <p>Hmmm. You ask&nbsp;yourself, does this look like I know what an 'average'  is? </p>
           <p>Or does it look like I'm my best friend <em>Dumbo Doug</em> who can't&nbsp;tell the difference between reggae and regatta, which is why he always dances during boat races?</p>
           <p>I'd better not define a term using the term that is being defined. Good idea, me! Well done. Ten<strong> </strong>points to MY house. Yay.           </p>
           <p><span class="myanswer">AVERAGE - Elias would get a value that summarises all of the data.</span></p>
           <p>Maybe not <em>perfect</em>, but close enough for one mark to show I know what an average is. Move on. </p>
           <p>Just because 3 blank lines are provided does <em>not</em> mean you must fill them <em>all</em>. They are merely a&nbsp;guide to the level of detail the examiner is looking for. In&nbsp;this case, 3 lines of writing for one mark is a bit rich.</p>
           <p>Do&nbsp;NOT fill unused space with irrelevant filler words. You will just waste your time and the examiner's patience.</p>
         <p><strong>Function 2</strong> (3 lines, 1 mark out of 2)</p>
         <p class="myanswer"> TOTAL - a summary of the value of all of the data in a field.</p>
         <p>It's hard to outline &quot;Total&quot;. Again, don't resort to defining the term using the term you're defining.</p>
         <p>At this point you may think, &quot;Perhaps I should have used my SORT option instead of TOTAL...&quot;. Too bad. Too late. We're done here. Move on.</p>
         <p>Have you demonstrated that you know two relevant spreadsheet functions? Yep. Expect full marks.         </p>

         <p>The question raises key points for you to highlight: <span class="examiner">Identify and describe two design principles that Elias should follow regarding the appearance of the infographic.&nbsp; 4 marks</span></p>
         <ul>
            <li>There are several design principles from which to choose. You are limited to those relating to <em>appearance</em>, which (according to the holy <a href="/glossary.html">glossary</a> - bless&eacute;d be the glossary) are: alignment, balance, contrast, image use, space, and text/table formatting. Discussing other design principles (ease of use, flexibility and robustness,  accessibility) will be a waste of time.</li>
            <li>How many? Two. Fortunately, the examiners have kindly provided two spaces for your answer.</li>
            <li>What to do with them? (i) identify (i.e. name them), (ii) describe&nbsp;(say what they are like)</li>
            <li>4 marks = how much should you write.&nbsp;Again, the examiners help by providing 3 blank lines. Writing less that that is OK if you fully answer the question. Writing more than that usually means you are not sure what your answer is or you're faking it and not fooling anyone.</li>
      </ul>
         <p>OK. Choose two design principles. Any two? Does the <em>context</em> of the question guide your decision? Does the case study help you or limit your choice as to what principles are  relevant? </p>
         <p>Consider the <em>audience</em> of the infographic: the local community. Does that suggest that a particular design principle is more important than the others? Not really. So, feel free to pick any two design principles.</p>
         <p>I'll cover them all - you would pick just two.</p>
         <ul>
            <li class="myanswer"><strong>alignment</strong> - the arrangement of the content relative to the margins of the screen or printed page:&nbsp;left or right&nbsp;justified, or centred horizontally. Vertical alignment would also be relevant.</li>
            <li class="myanswer"><strong>balance</strong> - the positioning of content so it is attractive and even, without excessive amounts in any one place or side (e.g. all the content is on the left margin and the right hand side is all empty).</li>
            <li> <span class="myanswer"><strong>contrast</strong> - clear difference between text colours and background colours&nbsp;- to improve readability.</span></li>
            <li class="myanswer"><strong>image use</strong> - are images needed at all? If so, are they relevant? Are they sized so their details are clear? Is colour necessary? (Printing in colour is expensive). Are colour choices attractive? Are colours visible to colour-blind people?</li>
            <li class="myanswer"><strong>space</strong> - blank areas are important to group related items together, separate items, highlight important parts, improve readability, give the reader a visual clue to the structure of the information. Spacing includes page margins, line&nbsp;spacing, spacing between paragraphs, indents.</li>
            <li class="myanswer"><strong>text/table formatting</strong> - tables: usually have centred, bold or large headings; numeric values are right-justified; cell padding avoids cell contents overlapping with cell borders. Text formatting choices include: typeface ('font')&nbsp;readability;  text size;  styling (e.g. bold, italic); underlined hyperlinks; colour (e.g. red for important/dangerous items).</li>
            </ul>
         <p>Note: when discussing a principle, <em>don't repeat</em> aspects you've used before - e.g. with text formatting, you wouldn't discuss text contrast colours or alignment if you'd already raised them when describing your other design principle.</p></td>

            <p class="myanswer">1. If the original data is destroyed in a disaster (e.g. fire), the only backups would also be destroyed, <em>client data could not be recovered</em> <em>and the ability to do business would be seriously damaged</em>.</p>
            <p class="myanswer">2. If the backup tape were stolen, private or valuable secret information might fall into the hands of competitors or be used unlawfully.</p>
         <p>In #1, notice the end bit shown in <em>italics</em>. If you&nbsp;had only said the backups would be destroyed, the reader might still&nbsp;be asking, &quot;So what? Why is that a bad consequence?&quot;</p>
         <p> The end bit in italics seals the deal and makes the point relevant. Moreover, it uses specific details from the case study (the reference to the client data) to nail the answer's relevance to the case study.</p>
         <p>The morals of the story:</p>
         <p>1. Make sure you fully answer the question and don't leave your reader wondering, &quot;So what?&quot;</p>
         <p>2. If given a case study, use relevant detail from it to ensure the relevance of your answer.</p></td>

            <p>Notes: </p>
            <p>- I started my original answer with, &quot;Without a disaster recovery plan...&quot; but threw it away because it only repeated the question and provided nothing towards an answer.</p>
            <p>- I used dotpoints to clearly separate the different reasons for my answer. Feel free to use your own dotpoints if the exam question&nbsp;does not provide separate spaces for them. They will help you ensure the different parts for your answer are in fact different, and are not the same point being repeated.</p>
            <p>- I provided 4 dotpoints. You should give 3. The question does not give a required number of points for your explanation, but it's safe to assume that one good, relevant point would be worth 1 mark. Saying the same point twice using different words = one point. Providing more than the required number of points is noble and sweet of you, <em>but you're not writing a textbook - you're answering an exam question</em>. Don't waste time. Earn your marks and <em>move on</em>.</p>
            <p>Unlike what your parents always taught you, <em>doing the bare minimum is A Good Thing</em>&nbsp;during an exam. The examiner is <em>not</em> thinking &quot;Ah, this candidate provided 4 truly wonderful points. If only he or she had gone on with another sixteen, I would have been delighted. Sigh.&quot;</p>
            <p>Sorry, mum. Sorry, dad. Sorry, legal guardian. But it's true.</p></td>
