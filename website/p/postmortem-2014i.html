      This page was updated 24 April 2015.<br />
      Its general comments (with my <strong>added emphasis</strong> of interesting bits) said...</p>
    <p class="examiner">In the 2014 Information Technology: IT Applications examination students were able to design screens for data capture, taking into account the particular needs described in a scenario. </p>
    <p class="examiner">Responses demonstrated that students were aware of a wide range of screen objects and could explain why, for example, a text box, radio button or check box could be chosen. </p>
    <p class="examiner">Many designs were enhanced by annotations and, if validation techniques were required, by the addition of associated error messages.<br />
      </p>
    <p class="examiner">In the design and development of a relational database management system (RDBMS), most students were able to correctly recommend data types, field and table names, and data formats. </p>
    <p class="examiner">Generally, students demonstrated an understanding of the purpose and process of normalisation. When presented with a flat file data table, most students provided partial solutions consistent with the first normal form INF.<br />
      </p>
    <p class="examiner">Students demonstrated skill at using their chosen software to solve problems presented in a variety of scenarios. <br />
      </p>
    <p class="examiner"><strong>However, many of the explanations that accompanied the designs that students created were difficult to follow because students confused evaluation with testing, and the term &lsquo;acceptance testing&rsquo; was used without any explanation or reference to the scenario.<br />
      </strong></p>
    <p class="examiner"><strong>Questions couched in terms of efficiency require responses that address one or more of the components of efficiency: time, cost or effort.</strong></p>
    <p class="examiner"><strong>Similarly, in the case of effectiveness, responses must address one or more of the components of effectiveness: accuracy, timeliness, completeness, readability, attractiveness, accessibility, relevance, usability, communication of message or clarity.</strong></p>
    <p class="examiner">      Students seemed to understand the roles of various procedures and equipment used within security strategies to protect data and information. </p>
    <p class="examiner">In <a href="#b7d">Question 7d</a>., many otherwise comprehensive responses were incomplete because students did not address the organisation&rsquo;s specific responsibility for the disposal of information.</p>
    <p class="examiner">    In general, responses that focused on the specific requirements stated in the question and that provided examples appropriate to the scenario were awarded full marks.</p></td>

      <p>The best design tool to represent the sequence of scenes in an online video game is a</p>
      <ol>
        A. storyboard.<br />
        B. layout diagram.<br />
        C. hierarchy chart.<br />
        D. annotated mock-up.
      </ol>
      <p class="myanswer">Answer is A.</p>
      <p class="comment">This is an odd one to begin with. Traditionally in VCE IT a storyboard has been used to refer to a tool to design the navigation through a website, like a more detailed sitemap. Now, apparently, they are using &quot;storyboard&quot; in the sense of a media storyboard that roughs out the action in animation or film. </p>
      <p class="comment">It worries me when examiners suddenly change their definitions, such as in the 2016 draft study design which was using &quot;accessibility&quot; in the sense of &quot;easy to find/download&quot; instead of &quot;catering for special needs&quot; ... I pointed that out, and think that it will be fixed before the final study design comes out. But when did 'storyboard' shift its definition?</p>

      <p class="comment">Don't get me started on this. They can, and <em>should</em> be determined during analysis, but no - the study design insists that physical design must begin first. I have no idea why, and no-one will tell me. That makes me sad.</p>

      <ol>
        A. errors in delivery address details recorded.<br />

      <p class="myanswer">Answer is C.</p>
      <p class="myanswer">The key word in the stem is &quot;efficiency&quot; - time, money, labour, ease of use. Errors (option A) is effectiveness. Incomplete records refers to quality, so it's also effectiveness. (D) refers to improper (inaccurate) orders being permitted. The only alternative is savings, option (C).</p>
      <p><span class="comment">I hope to see that in the final 2016 study design, &quot;ease of use&quot; will be removed as an efficiency measure. Such subjective metrics do not belong with the other objective, measurable efficiency criteria.</span></p>

        (D) is impossible, since it requires people to have two surnames. So it must be (C). <br />

        <strong>One</strong> owner can have <strong>many</strong> cars. So it's (B).</p>
      <p><span class="comment">As a tip - you will probably never see a 1:1 relationship in an exam, or in real databases. They are pretty pointless.<br />
        You will <strong>never</strong> see a real many:many relationship ever. Why? Because no RDBMS allows them! They exist only as a theoretical concept. To effect a many:many relationship, you must use an intermediary &quot;line table&quot; between two <strong>1:many</strong> tables to join them.</span><br />

        That leaves (A) and (C). <br />
        Accessing team lists in (A) is fine as far as it goes, but it does not cover medical data, so let's call it 'OK but incomplete'.<br />

        <span class="myanswer">A. Discount = [NormalHolidayCost] *.02 + [YearsOfService] + 50<br />
          B. Discount = 50 + [YearsOfService]*[NormalHolidayCost]*0.02<br />

          D. Discount = 50 + [YearsOfService]*0.02 + [NormalHolidayCost] </span>
      </ol>
      <p class="myanswer">Hmmm. (D) is odd. We don't need to add [NormalHolidayCost] to anything to get the answer. Doing that would always give a discount that was larger than the cost of the holiday! Kill it.</p>
      <ol>
        <span class="myanswer"> A. Discount = [NormalHolidayCost] *.02 + [YearsOfService] + 50<br />

          <s>D. Discount = 50 + [YearsOfService]*0.02 + [NormalHolidayCost]</s> </span>
      </ol>
      <p class="myanswer">We need to find an option that multiplies [YearsOfService] by .02 (which is 2%). <br />
        (A) doesn't. Cross it out.</p>
      <ol>
        <span class="myanswer"><s>A. Discount = [NormalHolidayCost] *.02 + [YearsOfService] + 50</s><br />
          B. Discount = 50 + [YearsOfService]*[NormalHolidayCost]*0.02<br />

          <s>D. Discount = 50 + [YearsOfService]*0.02 + [NormalHolidayCost]</s> </span>
      </ol>
      <p class="myanswer">Well, that only leaves (B). Let's test it, just to be sure our arithmetic is right... 'cos my arithmetic is terrible.</p>
      <p class="myanswer">Discount = 50 + [YearsOfService]*[NormalHolidayCost]*0.02 </p>
      <p class="myanswer">We need test data. Let's say... 10 years of service and [NormalHolidayCost] of 1000... <br />
        Nice round numbers help a lot.</p>
      <p class="myanswer">Discount = 50 + (10 * 1000 * .02) so<br />
        Discount = 50 + (10 * 20)
        so<br />
        Discount = 50 + 200<br />
        Discount = $250 on a normal cost of $1000.</p>

Quick start guides are one type of onscreen user documentation.</p>
  <p>a. Outline the purpose of a quick start guide. </p>
  <p align="right">1 mark [3 lines]</p>
  <p class="myanswer">It gives just enough information for the user to know how to install the software get it running safely.<br />
    The QSG is a way of 
  preventing impulsive and impatient users doing potentially destructive things before they bother to read the full manual and learn the error of their ways.</p>
  <p class="examiner">Most students were able to state the purpose of a quick start guide. A typical response was &lsquo;it provides brief help or simple step-by-step instructions when you start using hardware or software&rsquo;.</p>
  <p class="examiner">Average mark 80%</p>
  <p>b. Give <strong>one </strong>disadvantage of a quick start guide. </p>
  <p align="right">1 mark [2 lines]</p>
  <p align="left" class="myanswer">It is very brief and gives a very limited amount of information. Other information must be sought in the user manual.</p>
  <p align="left" class="comment">This is not really a &quot;disadvantage&quot; - it's the nature of the beast. You wouldn't say that the disadvantage of a DVD is that it cannot store 5TB of data, or that the disadvantage of a cat is that you can't saddle it and ride it to town. I think the wording of the question is ill-advised - &quot;limitation&quot; might be better than &quot;disadvantage&quot;, which implies that the QSG is being compared to something in the same class, but better.</p>
  <p align="left" class="examiner">The most common correct response was that a quick start guide cannot solve any unusual problems that are encountered. A number of students stated that a user must have a working computer to use an onscreen guide. This is a response that can apply to a wide range of software applications and does not sufficiently demonstrate understanding of the limitations of an online quick start guide compared to, for example, an online tutorial.</p>

<td><p><strong>Question 2</strong> (4 marks)<br />
A chat site was initially created for intranet use in a small company. The company has now decided to have an open section with internet access and add a multimedia option so that users can post videos and audio files.<br />
</p>
  <p>Explain how these <strong>two</strong> actions will affect accessibility.</p>
  <p>[10 lines]</p>
  <p class="comment">We all, ladies and gentlemen, know that &quot;accessibility&quot; refers to catering to disabilities or special needs. I'm going to be mightily annoyed if the suggested answer to this is interprets accessibility as &quot;ease of finding or loading&quot;. <strong>Mightily annoyed.</strong> In fact I can't think of an answer to this that does not use an invalid definition of accessibility. How could the internet access or multimedia options help colourblind men or people with shaky hands, for example? </p>
  <p class="comment">The question  seems to be clearly working with a non-standard definition of accessibility - which, sadly, is never defined in the glossary in the study design, but has always been assumed to have the 'special needs' meaning. <br />
    I am now determined to dig up how and where this tacit understanding began!</p>
  <p class="comment">What the examiner probably wants students to say is something like:</p>
  <p class="myanswer">The opening up of the intranet to the internet will make the chat site available to employees outside the LAN. It will also make the chat site available to non-employees.</p>
  <p class="comment"><span class="myanswer">Adding the multimedia option will let users interact with the site with more than text chat comments.</span></p>
  <p class="comment">(But what this could have to do with accessing the site, I have no idea.)</p>
  <p class="comment">Does it expect students to talk about restricting access to registered people? But that would no longer be an &quot;open&quot; section... but it would be more open that an employee-only chat site. I don't know.</p>
  <p class="comment">I don't like this question at all. </p>
  <p class="comment">It's ambiguous and vague. What key knowledge is it fishing for, exactly?<br clear="all" />
  </p>
  <p align="left"><img src="/m/schmacho.jpg" alt="" width="98" height="150" /></p>
  <p align="left" class="examiner">The first action<br />
    A chat site with an open section and access to the internet will attract users from a wide range of language and/or cultural groups. Students who explained that providing language options and culturally sensitive content protocols would support global interactions, be they social or knowledge-sharing, or collaboration on work-based projects, all received marks.<br />
    The second action<br />
    Adding audio and video options to the chat site will help meet the needs of a more diverse group of individual online community members. Students who explained that an audio option meets the needs of vision-impaired users or video and/or onscreen text helps meet the needs of hearing-impaired users all received marks. Generally, high-scoring responses suggested that a combination of video, audio and text modes increases accessibility and extends the likelihood of meeting the social needs of a wider range of individual users.<br />
    To gain full marks students needed to address both actions; however, many students focused only on one action.</p>

<p class="examiner">This question was answered well. Most students could identify equipment or a procedure to prevent unauthorised access directly to the report files or to the network and, in either case, explain how this security worked. The most frequently accepted responses included: a firewall to prevent hackers from entering the network, encryption to stop hackers from reading the content, and strong passwords that allowed authorised administrators to edit the reports and permitted students and parents to read the reports.<br />
  Similarly, students&rsquo; responses gave details of a range of procedures and equipment for ensuring the stored report files could be recovered if the server room were destroyed by fire or if the files in the server room were corrupted by a virus. These included backup to portable hard drives that are stored either off site or in a fireproof safe or stored on the cloud using a reputable business.</p>

<p class="myanswer">- For each non-empty textbox, perform a type check to ensure the entry is numeric, and a range check that verifies that the value is &gt;= 1 and &lt;= 15. (It excludes a value of 0 because that would be meaningless for an order.)<br />
  - This validates that the entry is a number within allowable limits.</p>
<p class="comment">Note the little dotpoints I used to make the technique and justification clearly separate? Markers like that sort of clarity.</p>
<p class="examiner">Students identified a number of electronic techniques to validate the value entered into the quantity (kg) text box. The most frequently accepted correct response was a range test technique where 0 &lt; = Quantity = &lt; 15 and a drop list displaying the numbers 0 to 15. Students who stated the range in words received marks, as did those who identified a type test and an existence test. Some students enhanced their response by explaining that when the value is outside the range, an appropriate error message is needed to help users understand what they have to do to proceed.</p>

<p>b. Identify and explain a concern that the receptionist may have with the buttons across the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p align="right"> 2 marks [4 lines]</p>
<p align="left" class="myanswer">- The close button is very near the save button. A tiny clicking error could inadventently close an unsaved order.</p>
<p align="left" class="myanswer">- Having to click the Total button to see the order total is an unnecessary click. The system could easily always display a current total whenever a value in any textbox is changed.</p>
<p align="left" class="examiner">This question was well answered. Most students identified the clutter of buttons as a problem that could cause the receptionist to click &lsquo;Close&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;Save&rsquo;. Another concern was the placement of all buttons across the bottom of the screen. Many students explained that buttons should be positioned according to the natural workflow of the screen. For example, the &lsquo;Total&rsquo; button should be closer to the &lsquo;Quantity (kg)&rsquo; text box because it will be clicked after the quantity value is entered.</p>

<p class="comment">Now, where were we? Ah yes. Time for a <strong>new</strong> rant...</p>
<p class="comment">Why, o why do people call any field with two possible values 'Boolean'? Boolean is a logical value - true or false. &quot;T&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are text. The only way the current styles could be encoded as proper Boolean is to call it 'Style_Is_Travel?' with a true/false answer, with false meaning the style is Business.</p>
<p class="examiner">Most students could demonstrate knowledge of data types to determine what changes needed to be made to an existing design to accommodate new products. Correct responses stated that Boolean must be changed (to text) in the Umbrella_Styles field because four styles cannot be represented by a &lsquo;1&rsquo; or a &lsquo;0&rsquo;, whereas the Accept field can stay Boolean because the two options can still be represented by &lsquo;1&rsquo; or &lsquo;0&rsquo;.</p>

They then enter the same order data into the system and compare the system's answer with the one they calculated. If the answers differ, either their arithmetic or the system needs to be fixed.<br />
  - This would verify that the system is using the right product data (e.g. style and price) and the right calculation algorithm to generate accurate output.</p>
<p class="examiner">A range test with the statement 0 &lt; = Order _Quantity &lt; 26 as part of the test data for one of the new Umbrella_Styles was the most frequently accepted response to this question.<br />
  Other statements of the range included 1 &lt; = Order _Quantity &lt; = 25 together with explanations such as &lsquo;Order_Quantity can be any integer from 1 to 25&rsquo;. Drop lists with the appropriate range were also suggested. A number of students suggested placing dummy orders with sets of test data to test every field. All of these responses received marks.</p>

Josh and Suzie were a popular singing duo who first wrote and performed songs during their last two years at school. During that time, they produced a CD of all their work together.</p>
  <p align="left">    Josh and Suzie have now gone their separate ways. Josh is starting a small business and is currently creating a website based on his particular music style. He plans to use songs from the CD, and images of Suzie and himself to showcase a series of future concerts.</p>
  <p align="left">a. What would be the consequences if Josh decided to follow his plan without consulting Suzie? </p>
  <p align="right">2 marks [6 lines]</p>
  <p align="left" class="myanswer"><a name="b6a" id="b6a"></a>- Using intellectual property shared with Suzie without her permission, Josh would be violating the Copyright Act (1968) and could face civil legal action.</p>
  <p align="left" class="myanswer">- It seems very unlikely that  Josh qualifies to be subject to the Privacy Act (1988), but using her image without permission could contravene the 'Use and disclosure' privacy principle because he's using the image for a purpose other than that for which it was originally given by the owner. That could lead to criminal prosecution.</p>
  <p align="left" class="myanswer">- More likely, using the image would have to be considered a ethically-dubious decision and could cause ill-feelings between Josh and Suzie.</p>
  <p align="left" class="examiner">This question required students to identify the consequences of Josh breaking the law or behaving unethically. Many students described Josh&rsquo;s action but did not go on to state consequences of that action for either himself or Suzie. Responses that received marks began, for example, with a statement such as &lsquo;Josh will be using Suzie&rsquo;s intellectual property without her knowledge&rsquo; and then stated, &lsquo;as a consequence Suzie could be upset and angry&rsquo;. Other consequences for Suzie could include she could be cheated of money, she could be cheated of fame or she could be embarrassed about her image being used. Examples of consequences for Josh include he could be sued, fined, forced to pay Suzie money, he could be forced to crop Suzie out of the publicity images or he could be forced not to proceed with the project.</p>
  <p align="left" class="examiner">Average mark 55%</p>
  <p align="left">b.  Explain <strong>one</strong> responsibility that Josh may have to Suzie. </p>
  <p align="right">2 marks [6 lines] </p>
  <p align="left" class="myanswer">- He needs to respect her co-ownership of the intellectual property in their songs.</p>
  <p align="left" class="myanswer">- He needs to treat privileged information (the image) with discretion and respect and protect the privacy of Suzie's personal information.</p>
  <p align="left" class="examiner">Josh has a responsibility to consult Suzie, ask her permission to use her image and their songs, offer to pay her a fair share of the profits, offer to include her in the credits or apologise for not consulting her. He should make sure she is aware of exactly how he intends to use her image and that she can give informed consent for her image to be used in the concerts.</p>
  <p align="left" class="examiner">Average mark 75%</p>
  <p align="left">c. Recommend a solution for resolving the tension between the consequences stated in <strong>part a</strong>.<br />
    and the responsibility stated in <strong>part b</strong>. </p>
  <p align="right">2 marks [6 lines]</p>
  <p align="left" class="myanswer">- He would need to either get permission to use Suzie's contributions to the songs, or to pay to license to use her share of the intellectual property.</p>
  <p align="left" class="myanswer">- He would need to get her permission to use her image for publicity since he's using it for a reason other than the one for which it was originally given.</p>
  <p align="left" class="examiner">Responses to this part were expected to address consequences identified in part a. and the responsibility stated in part b. Those students who set down a coherent plan for resolving or documenting the issues they had previously discussed received marks. For example, if Josh contacts Suzie and provides details of how he hopes to use their songs and share the profits with her, it will give her the opportunity to decide what she wants to do. This will put Suzie in the picture and reduce the tension caused by Josh not telling her what is happening.</p>

<p align="left" class="comment">Let me make a few thoughts clear on this.</p>
<p align="left" class="comment">- It's good that normalisation has been scaled back in this year's exam. Previous years' questions beat kids over the head brutally.</p>
<p align="left" class="comment">- It's also good that the question focused on a straightforward normal form - 1NF.</p>
<p align="left" class="comment">- But why, <strong>why</strong> did they mess it up and provide TWO repeating fields? If the second repeating field had been omitted, students could have demonstrated their understanding of 1NF quite neatly with this...</p>

<p align="left" class="comment">It's a reasonable amount of effort for only 3 marks, and it would fit into the space provided on the paper (33% of a page). The only other option is to create 15 records, 3 for each interest group - and the result would still be useless as a table.</p>
<p align="left" class="comment">Does it satisfy 1NF. Yep.<br />
  - It has no columns (fields) with the same sort of data in them.<br />
  - There is only one datum per field.</p>
<p align="left" class="comment">But sure - the second repeating field causes terrible problems.</p>
<p align="left" class="comment">Like - what is the table's key? Username is no longer unique, and even combining the first 3 fields into a compound key does not help. Do we use username+contactlist as the key? That would lead to drastic 2NF problems. But the question is not about 2NF, is it? We don't have to worry about that. We only need to achieve 1NF. </p>

<p class="examiner">This question required students to redesign any fields in the data table that could be broken into components and then provide an example of one record from the new data table. Most students who received marks replaced the name field with two new fields, lastName and firstName, and provided the following example.</p>

<p class="blue">It unpacks the multiple data items hidden in the repeating field so that the data can be used. As it is, interest group data is one lump of text: converting to 1NF isolates the individual interest group items and lets them be searched, sorted, counted etc.</p>
<p class="examiner">The most frequently accepted responses to this question were &lsquo;users can search a contact_List by lastName and find people they want quickly&rsquo; and &lsquo;a sort of interest_Groups can be searched by lastName&rsquo;.</p>

user acceptance of the new website? </p>
<p align="right">2 marks [4 lines]</p>
<p class="myanswer">She should recruit a few typical members of the organisation to use the website and report back (via interview, questionnaire, survey etc) on its functionality, usability and whatever other criteria were deemed important when the site was commissioned.</p>
<p class="examiner">Many students confused testing with evaluation. Those students who described test data and stated the expected results received marks. For example, Celeste could create a set of dummy users with known interests and then use a search function to see if the results were as expected. Many responses stated Celeste could use an acceptance test without describing what this involved.</p>

<p>Explain one advantage and one disadvantage of cloud storage for the safe disposal of data.</p>
<p align="right"> 2 marks [2 lines for each part]</p>
<p>Advantage </p>
<p class="myanswer">- A professional organisation should, in theory, be able to dispose of data in a more secure manner than the average amateur could (e.g. with military-grade data wiping, physical destruction of decommissioned disk drives etc).</p>
<p class="myanswer">- Traces of website data (e.g. memory sticks, hard disk files, printouts) would not be left lying around locally where local people could find them.</p>
<p>Disadvantage</p>
<p class="myanswer">- If the cloud host is poorly run, careless with disposal, or collapses financially and leaves 'deleted' data online then deleted data could be retrieved by unauthorised people. </p>
<p class="myanswer">- Unethical hosts might not actually delete the data, but sell it on to unknown third parties.</p>
<p class="myanswer">- Although data might be deleted from one storage location, backups and mirror copies at other data centres might not be deleted.</p>
<p><span class="examiner">Many responses to this question were general and did not describe an advantage or disadvantage specifically for Celeste. Many students did not address the cloud company&rsquo;s responsibility for disposing data and gave answers about general security.<br />
  The following is an example of a possible response.<br />
  Advantage<br />
  The cloud is easily accessed with just a click when Celeste is using the database. This makes it easy for Celeste to make regular backups or dispose of data. These tasks are all done for her.<br />
  Disadvantage<br />
  Celeste must rely on the cloud company&rsquo;s reputation for the disposal of stored data and, as the actual location of the cloud server that stores the data is not always known, Celeste cannot be sure the company follows correct disposal procedures.</span></p>

    <p><img src="/m/pm/14i-B11-mockup.gif" width="562" height="593" alt="B11" /></p>
    <p class="comment">IMPORTANT - notice that my design does <strong>not</strong> require the entry of name or ID. This is because any member accessing this page <strong>must</strong> have already successfully logged in and authenticated their identity, so the website does not need this information to be entered again. To do so would be useless (since an authorised person pretending to be a member could also easily enter their name) and unnecessary (because the user's identity is already known.)</p>
    <p class="comment">You could design things differently to achieve full marks. I have not provided full formatting details (fonts, colours, alignment etc) but at this end of the exam your time may be short and hopefully you showed your ability to do this in <a href="#b9">question B9</a>. I'm quite worried about the amount of repetition in this exam.</p>
    <p class="comment">This answer makes sure the specifics of the question are focused on. If you had the time, it would be wise to add the detailed formatting information. Or draw a picture of a pussy cat on the back cover. Whatever.</p>
    <p class="comment">I think it's wise to make the marker's life easy and identify where you have satisfied the question's criteria, even if a later question explicitly asks you to do so (as the next question does). Highlighting the places where you satisfy a question's criteria is valuable to <strong>you</strong> because it acts as a checklist to ensure you have provided everything that was asked for.</p>
    <p class="comment">It also reminds you to read all parts of questions before starting to answer any of them. It's not acceptable to answer a question by saying &quot;Please refer to previous question&quot; because you inadvertently and prematurely answered a question that you didn't know was coming up later. </p>
    <p class="examiner">This question was generally well answered. Most students provided a design for an online poll headed with the club name, included a text box for comments that indicated a 100-character maximum and a statement of the club&rsquo;s privacy policy or other feature to indicate that data being supplied by individuals was protected.<br />
      Most designs used labelled radio buttons and images of two options for the new club uniform for which members could vote. A number of students confused ensuring only one voting option could be selected with the requirement that &lsquo;a vote must be placed&rsquo;. Those students who made checking a voting option a required field and/or had an error alert that reminded a member to vote before he/she left the page received marks. The diagram below lists the features most frequently found in responses that received marks.</p>

      <li class="myanswer">The privacy comment at the bottom tells votes how their information will be used, how it is protected, and how to enquire about the use of their information.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="examiner">This question was very well answered. Most students could describe how their design met one of the requirements. Examples for each requirement are shown below.<br />
      &#61623; A vote must be placed.<br />
      &ndash; Checking a radio button is a required field. This means the form cannot be submitted until a vote is cast.<br />
      &#61623; Each member knows they are on the correct page to vote.<br />
      &ndash; The Big Mountain Football Club logo or title is on the top of the page and the page is headed &lsquo;Place Your Vote&rsquo;.<br />
      &#61623; Members have space to make brief (100 characters) additional comments before submitting their vote.<br />
      &ndash; A textbox labelled &lsquo;Add your comment&rsquo; is included so that users can type in whatever text they wish.<br />
      &#61623; There is evidence that the rights of individuals supplying data are being protected. A statement on how Big Mountain Football Club secures users&rsquo; data or adheres to legal requirements is at the bottom of the page.</p>

      each member can register only one vote, and not revisit the page multiple times to vote? </p>
    <p align="left" class="comment">This is classic ITA ambiguous questioning, which I'd hoped they had got over.</p>
    <p align="left" class="comment">The question really seems to be implying multiple voting, but interpretation (2) is unlikely:  a mock-up design could not hope to ensure that a member was not voting more than once. Yes, the <strong>database</strong> could do that, but the page design could <strong>not</strong>. </p>
    <p align="left" class="comment">That leaves interpretation (1) - which obviously does not say what it is trying to mean. To &quot;respond only once&quot; surely means &quot;vote once&quot;, assuming that &quot;responding to the poll&quot; is a synonym for &quot;voting&quot;. The wording does <strong>not</strong> suggest anything about &quot;choosing one, and only one option.&quot;</p>
    <p align="left" class="comment">Maybe the question writer had a &quot;checkbox/radio button&quot; decision in mind, but that thought never made it safely onto paper. I have not bestowed an Illiteracy Award for a while. This question certainly deserves one.</p>

    <p align="left" class="comment">It's questions like this that make me wonder about the effectiveness of the ESL checking of ITA papers.</p>
    <p align="left" class="examiner">A number of workable solutions were suggested to solve the problem presented in this question. Generally, the ideas were coherent, detailed and used technically accurate terminology. A typical example was, &lsquo;In the data table, have a YES/NO field or column to record that a user has voted. Then make the voting form accessible only to users whose record shows they have not voted&rsquo;.</p>

<p align="left" class="comment">Again - I <strong>refuse</strong> to inappropriately use Boolean just because a field has 2 possible values. </p>

<p align="left" class="comment">The only way to legitimately use Boolean would have been to name the field <strong>boolIs_Option1</strong> which <strong>does</strong> render a true/false answer, but is completely inintelligible and a poor attempt to save storage space, since AFAIK MS Access uses 1 byte to store a Boolean value.</p>
<p class="examiner">This question was well answered. Most designs for a database table included an appropriate title for the table, headings and data types for the Member_ID, Uniform_Option and Member_Comments fields. Responses that also included an example of one user&rsquo;s record received full marks. The diagram below illustrates features most frequently found in high-scoring responses.</p>

<p align="left" class="examiner">A number of responses correctly illustrated a database or spreadsheet table but gave an example of the total vote for each option. They received some marks.</p>

</ul>
<p class="examiner">Most students listed steps to test the database or spreadsheet table. Responses that included detailed descriptions and examples for each step received full marks. Typical of an accepted response was &lsquo;they could create nine dummy users and enrol them as members with usernames, and place four votes for one option and five for the other option, then check if the data stored is as expected&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="examiner">Average mark 45%</p>

  No. I think we're done here. Hope it was useful.<br />

<p>Hey Mark,<u></u><u></u></p>
<p>  Just thought I&rsquo;d let you know about what my class and I thought about the ITA 2014 exam.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p><u></u><u></u>To be honest, it was pretty annoying. It seemed they threw away marks for questions which anyone off the street could do (primarily questions 9 and 11).<u></u><u></u></p>
<p><u></u><u></u>There was basically nothing on cables, networks, types of servers etc. Instead they just tested your knowledge of effectiveness vs efficiency over and over and over again. Quite annoying when you did 20 odd practice exams, and the actual exam covers a really small proportion of the content.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p><u></u>&nbsp;<u></u>Finally, the vagueness kills me. Accessibility now suddenly refers to a completely different thing? Fantastic.<u></u></p></td>
