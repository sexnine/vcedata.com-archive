 <li>The pivot was 17, but was not 19. </li>
 <li>The pivot was not 17, but it could have been 19. </li>
 </ol>
 <p class="myanswer">Answer is B.<span class="explanation"> I'll stake 5 cents on it. I'm hoping...</span></p>
 <p class="explanation">For most students, I suspect this was a brain-destroying question to start off section A. </p>
 <p class="explanation">I instinctively started trying to reverse-engineer the starting state of the array, before realising that it was like trying to unscramble an egg. It took a while to go back to first principles: quicksort divides an array into 2 subarrays with a point somewhere in it (the pivot) that separates the values <em>smaller</em> than the pivot value from all values <em>greater</em> <em>than </em> the pivot value.</p>
 <p class="explanation">This meant that having to carry out a quick sort was not necessary. It involved more basic principles inherent to quick sort.</p>
 <p class="explanation">After a partition, there will be a value (the pivot) that will only have <em>smaller</em> values to its left, and only greater (or equal) values to its right. </p>
 <p class="explanation">Taking each datum in turn and applying this rule...</p>
 <ul>
  <li class="explanation">It can't be 12 because 11 is to its right.</li>
  <li class="explanation">Same for 15.</li>
  <li class="explanation">Can't be 11 because a larger value is to its left (12 and 15).</li>
  <li class="explanation"><strong>Could be 17</strong>, because it has only smaller values leftwards and larger values rightwards.</li>
  <li class="explanation"><strong>Also could be 19</strong> for the same reason.</li>
  <li class="explanation">Can't be 22 because a smaller value (21) is on its right.</li>
  <li class="explanation">Can't be 20 because larger values are to its left.</li>
 </ul>
 <p class="explanation">I'm guessing 98% of you just guessed an answer. It took me an hour (and three Youtube tutorials) to finally decide. This is a luxury you do not have in exam conditions. The lesson here (apart from pivot stuff) is that if you get a multichoice question that takes more than a couple of minutes to be sure about - SKIP IT and come back if you have time. Do not spend 15 minutes stubbornly trying to earn one single mark - especially when there's a 25% chance you'll get the mark by sheer luck anyway.</p>
 <p class="myanswer"><em>Dog almighty, this was a brutal way to start off a nice, friendly exam!</em> <em>It was not unfair or unclear - in fact I tip my hat to its clever questioning and focus on core theoretical principles - but by golly there will be a few sad and confused puppies in the cohort after this question.</em></p>

 <td valign="top" ><p><strong>Question 3</strong></p>
  <p>  The algorithm needs to be tested for logic errors.<br />
  Which of the following sets of test data would provide the best test for the algorithm?</p>
  <ol type="A">
  <li>0,75,80,84,100 </li>
  <li>75, 76, 84, 85</li>
  <li>70, 75, 76, 80</li>
  <li>0, 74, 84, 85</li>
 </ol>
  <p class="myanswer">Answer is B.</p>
<p class="explanation">Another challenging question. Consider the options. None of them leap out as immediately ridiculous, so there are no quick and easy cross-outs to be made.</p>
<p class="explanation">We need to thoroughly check ALL possible valid data inputs. We need to focus on boundary conditions where the logic of the code may fail.</p>
<p class="explanation">These valid inputs are not defined, but we can assume 0 to 100.</p>
<p class="explanation">The 3 valid ranges and their boundaries are (paying close attention to the &gt;= and &gt; signs)</p>
<ol>
 <li class="explanation">0 to 75 (C grade).</li>
 <li class="explanation">76 to 84 (B grade)</li>
 <li class="explanation">85 and above (A grade)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
 <li class="explanation">Option A tests ranges 1 (0,75), 2 (80,84), 3 (100).</li>
 <li class="explanation">Option B tests ranges 1 (75), 2 (76,84), 3 (85)</li>
 <li class="explanation">Option C tests ranges 1 (70,75), 2 (76,80). It does not test range 3. Cross this option out.</li>
 <li class="explanation">Option D tests ranges 1 (0,74), 2 (84), 3 (85)</li>
</ul>
<p class="explanation">Options A, B and D all test the 3 possible ranges of valid inputs. (A) has more tests and does not focus on boundary values as well as (B). Option (D) also lacks boundary-specific tests. So of the 3 complete sets, B would be the most likely to uncover boundary condition faults in the code's logic.</p>

   <p>  When a student upgrades their operating system to a new version of the operating system, the updating software creates a new folder called &lsquo;OperatingSystem.old&rsquo; and copies some of the computer&rsquo;s files to that folder.<br />

   <ol type="A">

    <li>backing up the computer&rsquo;s files.</li>
    <li>cleaning up the computer&rsquo;s files.</li>
    <li>creating extra space for the computer&rsquo;s files.</li>
   </ol>
   <p class="myanswer">According to the wording of the question, the answer would be B -<span class="comment"> but the question is badly written and common sense should lead to the answer of A.</span></p>
 <p class="explanation">Hmmm.</p>
 <p class="explanation">An <strong>archive</strong> moves a copy of data into offline storage. It deletes the original data.</p>
 <p class="explanation">A <strong>backup</strong> copies (and keeps) the original data. It is intended to allow recovery of lost data.</p>
 <p class="explanation">The question says the old OS files are 'copied' to the new folder. That means the original files remain in place and are <em>not deleted</em>. That is a backup.</p>
 <p class="explanation">The question would need to have said &quot;<em>moves</em> some of the computer's files&quot; to qualify as archiving.</p>
 <p class="explanation">The problem is, in <em>real</em> operating system upgrades, &quot;old&quot; folders contain OS data that <em>has been copied, then deleted</em> and replaced by newer versions - which is an archive.</p>
 <p class="comment">The question is flawed. If the original files are only copied and the originals are left in place, it's a backup. If the original files are moved and the originals are deleted, it's an archive.</p>
 <p class="comment">The question says that files are <em>copied</em>, not moved. It must be a backup - but that does not happen in The Real World&#8482;. Why copy files to a new folder when the originals are left in place? It makes no sense for an operating system upgrade to retain old, incompatible versions of files in its active system software store.</p>

 <p class="explanation">Well it obviously can't be C, which is a search, not a sort. That leaves 3 little piggies.</p>
 <p class="explanation">If it were a bubble sort (B), the first few pairs would have been swapped, leading to 6, 13, 25 - which isn't right. Rule that out too.</p>
 <p class="explanation">I'm assuming a <em>good</em> exam would <em>not re-examine</em> quick sort again so quickly, so I consider it wiser to next investigate <strong>selection sort</strong> rather than binary search as next contender...</p>

<p class="comment">At least they got the assignment arrows right this time.</p>
<p class="comment">One thing I find concerning is the use of the len( ) function. Pseudocode is supposed to be completely intuitive and readable and self-explanatory. Any invented functions should either be blatantly-obvious or explained in a comment. The len( ) function is an invention that - supposedly - returns the number of elements in the named array. So if nums[ ]  had 5 elements, len(nums) would return 5. But that is not immediately and blindingly obvious to students whose programming language did not use that name for the function, or used a different name for it. From my personal experience, len( ) is a function that returns the length of a <strong>string</strong>.</p>
<p class="comment">Let's make a deal, VCAA - you may invent any useful function you like for exams, but they must be either crystal clear or self-explanatory in meaning (e.g. 'Display') or explained in a comment, such as...</p>

  <li>mobile</li>
  <li>rich client</li>
  <li>thin client</li>

 </ol>
  <p class="myanswer">Answer is A.</p>
  <p class="comment">I expect there will be arguments over this one, and most kids would have been scratching their heads during the exam. </p>
  <p class="explanation">The stem says that an internet connection is not needed, but is some other communications (e.g. wifi or Bluetooth) required? </p>
  <p class="explanation">The app is said to be &quot;standalone&quot; which means it needs no connection to remote data or code sources. So let's assume no comms are needed at all. Think of a self-contained game like Solitaire on a phone. So, which architecture would suit?</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="explanation">Rich client means that the host computer has all the processing power and ability required with no support needed from external sources, such as cloud processors. The average computer is rich client since it does all of its own processing.</li>
    <li class="explanation">Thin client is the scheme whereby the host computer has minimal processing facilities, and relies on an external source to supply the processing grunt. The host computer acts more like a dumb screen and keyboard to enter data and view the information that has been created by another computer. Think of cheap, low-powered Chromebook computers that use cloud processing. Without the external processors, a thin client terminal is little more than a paperweight.</li>
    <li class="explanation">Peer-to-peer means that in a network of devices, each one has equal rights to initiate transactions (e.g. sharing files locally on a small LAN, or sharing files globally via Bittorrent). I can't see how it's relevant to this situation involving a standalone app.</li>

  <li>An XML data file will work as expected if some data is modified.</li>
  <li>An XML data file will never work as expected if some data is modified.</li>
  <li>An XML data file is interchangeable with an HTML file because they are both mark-up languages.</li>
 </ol>
  <p class="myanswer">Answer is B. <span class="explanation">I reckon.</span></p>
  <p class="explanation">XML is new theory, and many people will not be very familiar with it. </p>
  <p class="explanation">The answer will not be (A). XML  is used in many places other than web pages: it is a flexible all-purpose, plain-text, human-readable way to store and communicate self-contained, structured data files. </p>
  <p class="explanation">I have done a lot a work with XML because the database I made for teachers to create semester reports had to generate XML to feed into the education department's system. It was certainly possible to modify data within an XML file, considering it is plain text. Mind you, XML will break if you muck around with the tags in the file, but not the data within the tags. So (B) is true.</p>
  <p class="explanation">And therefore (C) is not true.</p>
  <p class="explanation">It is true that XML and HTML both use markup tags to provide structure to data content, but that's where the similarity ends. Otherwise you'd have to say that worms and garden hoses are basically the same because they're both long and thin with a hole in the middle.  </p>

<p align="left">Inta is writing a new application for a small bicycle company so its staff can use their mobile phones to access the stock information stored on the company&rsquo;s fileserver. In the company, there is a manager and four people who sell the bicycles. They all use different brands of mobile phones.<br />
  To help her with writing the software requirements specifications (SRS), Inta should</p>
  <ol type="A">
  <li>interview all those who will use the new application.</li>
  <li>send out a survey to the manager and one other staff member.</li>
  <li>observe one of those who will use the new application at work.</li>
  <li>survey some of the people who have bought bicycles from the company.</li>
 </ol>
  <p class="myanswer">Answer is A.</p>
  <p class="explanation">Hmmm. Interesting. What key knowledge is this question fishing for? What exactly is being examined? </p>
  <p class="explanation">Is it testing understanding of <strong>who</strong> should be consulted?</p>
  <p class="explanation">Or is it testing understanding of <strong>how</strong> they should be consulted?</p>
  <p class="explanation">Or could it be testing <strong>both</strong>?</p>
  <p class="explanation">I'm thinking of SD U3O2 KK 1 in the study design - &quot;techniques for collecting data to determine needs and requirements, including interviews, surveys and observation&quot;.</p>
  <p class="explanation">The question smells very much like a fishing expedition for knowledge of KK1 - data collection techniques.<br />
  </p>
  <p class="explanation">This is another arguable one. One could say that interviewing <strong>all</strong> users (A) would be over-the-top and that just one user and the manager (B) would suffice. But there is that rather odd comment in the case study - <strong>&quot;They all use different brands of mobile phones.&quot;</strong> </p>
  <p class="explanation">&quot;Why is that there?&quot; you should  ask, for stuff is not put into questions as filler or fun. It must be relevant to guiding your decision. </p>
  <p class="explanation">So - how could it be relevant? What options might it be intended to rule out?</p>
  <p class="explanation">If all users have different types of phones, they would all have different experiences and needs from the app. One person, for example, might have a small screen and require the app to be designed with minimal output on each page. Another might have a phone with a stylus, which would enable hand-written input. Another might have a phone with a different constraint that would rule out an important design idea. That comment in the case study makes me lean towards option (A).</p>
  <p class="explanation">But looking at (B), one realises that the manager would be an important person to consult to determine the organisation's functional requirements for the app. But will the manager be using the app - and therefore be included in option A, and be interviewed? </p>
  <p class="comment">Sadly the wording of the case study is ambiguous - a common fault in VCAA IT exams. We are told that &quot;In the company, there is a manager and four people who sell the bicycles.&quot;</p>
  <p class="comment">This could mean...</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="comment"> 1. In the company, there is a manager and four people, who <strong>(all five of them)</strong> sell the bicycles. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class="comment">or</p>

    <p class="comment">(A and B) doing C</p>

  <p class="comment">VCAA really needs a punctuation and grammar manager. <br />
    It may alleviate the frequent ambiguities in VCAA study designs and exams.</p>
  <p class="explanation">As a former English teacher, these things leap out at me. And that's why VCAA exams often annoy me more than they irritate other people.</p>
  <p class="explanation">But, it's section A and we can't explain our reasoning or give alternative answers to cope with ambiguities in the questions. We have to decide. Here I look at option B's data collection technique - survey - and wonder. Would a survey be sufficient? <br />
    Surveys are composed of closed-answer questions with limited opportunities to provide answers. Surveys are designed for mass data collection to be undertaken after detailed initial fact-finding (using interviews and observation) has uncovered what is relevant to the topic in question. No, surveys are not suitable here. </p>
  <p class="explanation">Remember - knowledge of interviews, surveys and observation are required by SD U3O2 KK 1.</p>
  <p class="explanation">Let's down-vote (B).</p>
  <p class="explanation">Option (C) is fair enough - observing users can uncover valuable ideas that may contribute to the formulation of functional or non-function requirements (e.g. sales staff may be very busy so the app would need to work more quickly than usual.) But only observing only <strong>one</strong> user would probably not be enough.</p>
  <p class="explanation">Option (D) is feasible and might yield some insight into the requirements of the new system, but it is less valuable than getting input from the actual users of the proposed system. It's not a strong option.</p>
  <p class="explanation">So, I'd say option (A) best answers the question, even though some of the others also have some merit. </p>
<p class="comment">Fun fact 1: Inta is a feminine Latvian given name. It's about time female Latvian programmers got mentioned in an exam question.  <br />

     <p>  A local shopping centre is considering providing free wi-fi for its customers.<br />
      Which one of the following would be a non-functional requirement for its new system?</p>
     <ol type="A">
       <li>The system must have a failure rate of less than 3%.</li>
       <li>The system must be easy for customers to connect to.</li>
       <li>The system must be able to cope with 500 simultaneous users.</li>
       <li>The system must have a speed of at least 5 megabits per second.</li>
      </ol>
     <p class="myanswer">Answer is B. But I don't like it much.</p>
     <p class="explanation">[This section is in development - which is why it rambles.]</p>
     <p class="explanation">A <strong>non-functional requirement</strong> (NFR) is a quality or a performance characteristic that a solution must possess. It usually describes what a <strong>user</strong> requires from the system. Being 'easy to connect to' is such a quality. <br />
      (For those of you who were guessing, it's also the only option without a specific number in it. That makes it stand out.)     </p>
     <p class="explanation">A <strong>functional requirement</strong> (FR) relates to what a system must be able to <strong>do</strong>. It often describes what a system's owner/manager requires from the system.</p>
     <p class="explanation">So...</p>
     <p class="explanation">FR - the system must be able to email a customer a record of a purchase. (What the system can <strong>do</strong>)<br />
      NFR - the system must be able to send the email within 5 minutes of the transaction. (<strong>How</strong> the system should do it)</p>
     <p class="comment">But let's quibble, shall we? Do you have time? Good. Please sit down, and let's quibble together. <br />
      No, not like <strong>that</strong>. That's not 'quibbling'. That's just awful. Stop it.</p>
     <p class="comment">I see an NFR is a global quality of a solution - it describes what the solution should <strong>be</strong>. <br />
      An NFR  is probably not achieved in a single procedure (as an FR would be) - it is often an outcome often born of many parts of a solution, e.g. 'easy to use' or 'secure' as a whole may require many pieces of programming in different procedures to achieve. <br />
      An NFR is usually related to what the solution's user wants and experiences.
      <br />
    </p>
     <p class="comment">A functional requirement (FR) on the other hand is an action that a solution must be able to <strong>do</strong>, particularly related to inputs, outputs and processing requirements, e.g. <strong>produce</strong> a graph of weekly sales, <strong>send</strong> an email to a customer after each purchase. <br />
       FRs require active <strong>verbs</strong>. <br />
       Such activities need to be specifically programmed, and are usually found in specific modules. <br />
       If a programmer is told that a system must have a failure rate &lt; 3% he/she might complain, &quot;Yeah - but where? What module/function are you talking about? Or do you mean the code should be generally reliable? How do we test this achievement?&quot;<br />
       Yes, an FR is rather specific, but does <strong>not</strong> have to have a number attached, as A20 implies. A20 assumes that if an objective is so specific that it has a number attached, it must be an FR.</p>
     <p class="comment">Alas, FRs and NFRs are not defined in the study design. So, when did VCAA decide to define an FR as a specific, numerically-defined <em>objective</em>? - like a system objective? (Also see the <a href="#c2">system objective question in C2</a> below)</p>
     <p class="comment">I rue the day that the study design had to cut back on the scope of the glossary. It's questions like this that make such definitions essential.</p>
     <p class="myanswer">To quote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_requirement">Mr Wikipedia</a>:</p>
     <blockquote>
       <p class="comment">&quot;Generally, functional requirements are expressed in the form &quot;system must do &lt;requirement&gt;&quot;, while non-functional requirements are &quot;system shall be &lt;requirement&gt;&quot;.  </p>
   </blockquote>
     <p class="comment"><a href="http://www.scaledagileframework.com/nonfunctional-requirements/">Another source</a> says: (with my inserts in <strong>bold</strong>)</p>
     <blockquote>
       <p class="comment">Nonfunctional Requirements (NFRs, or system qualities) describe system attributes such as security, reliability <strong>[option A]</strong>, maintainability,<br />
         scalability <strong>[option C]</strong>, and usability <strong>[option B]</strong> (often referred to as the &quot;ilities&quot;). They can also be constraints or restrictions on the design of the system (in         which they may be referred to as design constraints)... </p>
     </blockquote>
     <p class="comment">The exam's interpretation of FRs and NFRs in A20 seems to be new and idiosyncratic.</p>
     <p class="comment">End of quibble.</p>
     <p class="comment">Yes, you can stop now.</p>

   <p align="left">A hash function has been created to store a set of different integers in an array. The hash function creates a key value from the integer. The hash function takes the integer to be stored, divides the integer by 5 and uses the remainder as an index value.

 <p align="left">Patel and Janette started a small, suburban physiotherapy clinic. They both have a professional interest in a holistic approach<sup>1</sup> to health and wellbeing.<br />
Business has been steady, so Patel and Janette decided to expand the number of clinics and have established four clinics around the state. They have called their business &lsquo;Soul &amp; Body Health&rsquo;.<br />
One of the clinics has become their head office and it contains their fileserver and the commercial medical software required to keep patient records, both medical and financial.<br />
There is also a connection to the national healthcare system so that rebates<sup>2</sup> may be claimed from the government. The commercial medical software also allows Soul &amp; Body Health to upload other data files to the healthcare system.<br />
The other three clinics use virtual private network (VPN) connections to the head office.<br />
Patel and Janette feel that they can improve patient care by introducing preventive medicine techniques. So they have decided to provide extra services to their patients by incorporating a fitness application (app) called Keep Fit.<br />
The purpose of the app is twofold:</p>
 <ol>
  <li>To allow patients to make appointments and pay fees online to the head office</li>
  <li>To provide an online recording service to help patients record their dietary intake as well as their daily exercise regime</li>
 </ol>
 <p>Patel and Janette believe that patients will benefit from detailed knowledge of their eating and exercising habits. The data will be held locally on each patient&rsquo;s mobile device and then uploaded to the Soul &amp; Body Health server each night or when it is convenient.<br />
  Patel and Janette feel that, in addition to having detailed knowledge of their eating and exercising habits, patients will benefit from a more holistic approach by also maintaining an accurate record of their diet and exercise plan.</p>
 <p><sup>1</sup><strong> holistic approach</strong> - an approach concerned with the whole person (physical, mental and emotional)<br />
   <sup>2</sup> <strong>rebate</strong> - return of part of an amount paid or due for a service</p>

    The next step would be to demonstrate the entire system to Janette and Patel, and to make modifications. This should take another five days. Then they would need to install the new software on the server at the clinic and test it using the app, which would take another five days.<br />

     <p class="myanswer"> <span class="explanation">&quot;Also, that &lt;&lt;includes&gt;&gt; line from 'Book appt' to the login use case crosses the association line, which looks really awkward and ugly. So maybe there's only <strong>one</strong> &lt;&lt;includes&gt;&gt; arrow. OK. Maybe I was right - there's no need to already be on the system to be able to make an appointment.

   <p>Patel and Janette have asked the developers to take a simple approach to the design of the Keep Fit app. They want error-handling features, simple navigation between the components of the solution, and a clean and clear interface that allows for easy data entry regardless of the device. They also want it to be interesting to look at.<br />
    Sue-Lee has developed two design ideas for the app. Each design idea includes a start screen and one of the data entry screens. The design ideas are shown below.<br />

   <p class="explanation">Query - is the app meant to be seen as <strong>part of</strong> the Soul &amp; Body Health system? If so, the app cannot not be classed as an external entity. That's how I read it. Instead, the <strong>patient</strong> would be the data provider/entity.</p>
   <p class="comment">Note 1 - the question is asking for a data flow FROM each entity, not TO it.

<p>b. Describe <strong>one</strong> backup procedure that could be used to back up this data. Make reference to the technique used and the frequency of the backup procedure. 3 marks.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <strong>cloud-based</strong> backup system could be set up to store all new and modified data immediately to a remote cloud server hosted by a reliable and reputable cloud host. Any data loss would be minimal since all changes are backed up instantly. Since the data is stored <strong>offsite</strong>, local disasters would not damage the backups. The backup scheme will be <strong>tested</strong> regularly with test data to ensure recovery works as expected. The backup procedure will be <strong>documented</strong> so new staff in charge of backups will know how it's done properly.</li>
  <li>At the <strong>end of each day's business</strong> (when files are closed and able to be copied, and the network will not be slowed by a backup), an <strong>incremental backup</strong> of all new and changed data can be copied to tape or a USB hard disk and <strong>stored offsite</strong>. Once a week, a <strong>full backup</strong> of the entire system would be taken and stored offsite. In case of disaster, the latest full backup can be restored, followed by all incremental backups taken since the full backup. The backup scheme will be <strong>tested</strong> regularly with test data to ensure recovery works as expected. The backup procedure will be <strong>documented</strong> so new staff in charge of backups will know how it's done properly.</li>
</ul>
<p class="explanation">Did you know: Rumours of the demise of tape backups have been greatly exaggerated. Tape backup is still alive and well in the corporate world, and can still kick hard disk's backside in terms of storage capacity and speed. Amazing, but true. </p>
   <p>c. It has been suggested that patients who have not visited Soul &amp; Body Health for over five years should have their records archived. Explain what is meant by archiving and provide <strong>one</strong> advantage of archiving records. 3 marks<br clear="all" />
     </p>
   <p>Archiving is the copying of old, unwanted, irrelevant, bulky records to <strong>offline</strong> storage (for example disc, tape, hard disk) that is still accessible, but requires media to be located and loaded before data can be read. The original data is <strong>deleted</strong> after being copied.</p>
   <p>The <strong>advantage</strong> of archiving is that storage space is freed up for new, active data.<br clear="all" />
   </p>
   <p align="left"><span class="explanation">Note my use of emphasis to mark the answer to each part of the question, and to stress key concepts that make all the difference, such as the deletion of archived data (compared with <strong>backup</strong> data which is copied and retained in place.) If you make the marker's job easier by stressing key parts of your answer, everyone is better off. In an exam, you can underline or highlight key text.</span><br />

   <p>Patel has questions about the use of patient information. He is concerned about who owns the patient information stored on Soul &amp; Body Health&rsquo;s system and what his legal obligations are concerning this information.<br />
    Outline three actions that Patel should take to ensure that he meets Soul &amp; Body Health&rsquo;s legal obligations before purchasing the software.</p>
   <p class="myanswer">1. Patel is subject to the <strong>Privacy Act 1988</strong> because he holds health information about people. He must ensure that the information: is well protected and not used for any other purpose than that for which it was collected; not disclosed; is accurate, complete and up to date. He must also clearly advertise his privacy policy and allow information owners to check what is stored about them.</p>
   <p class="myanswer">2. Under the Victorian <strong>Health Records Act 2001</strong> - basically everything is repeated as for the Privacy Act.</p>
   <p class="myanswer">3. Under the <strong>Spam Act 2003</strong>, Patel would need to know that the software would not be used to send unsolicited commercial email to patients.</p>
   <p class="explanation">The relevance of the <strong>Spam Act</strong> is a bit of a stretch, I grant you, but three actions are needed. Maybe I could have unpacked required actions from the Privacy Act and just used those. The question did not demand three different <strong>laws</strong> to be quoted; it asked for three <strong>actions</strong>, and there's no reason they could not have been based on a single relevant law. I went the difficult route to show you how the question might have been handled.</p>
   <p class="explanation">The first paragraph of the question relates onto to privacy legislation, but the rest of it only refers to &quot;legal obligations&quot; in <strong>general</strong>, not purely those related to privacy. So it might be relevant to bring in the <strong>Copyright Act 1968</strong> and say that Patel must ensure the software is legally owned by the seller. Again, a stretch.</p>
   <p><span class="explanation">Note that the   <strong>Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014</strong> is not relevant since S&amp;BH is not a state government body or agency.</span></p>
   <p class="explanation">Also, the only other legislation - the <strong>Charter of Human Rights &amp; Responsibilities Act (Vic) 2006</strong> -  doesn't have any relevance to this case.</p>

   <p>The Keep Fit app will record all exercise that a patient does and calculate the energy used. It will    give the patient a choice of exercise style and then ask questions such as distance travelled and how    much time the exercise took.<br />
    One exercise that can be selected is running. The app takes into account the patient&rsquo;s weight and any other special factors in a disability index that a physiotherapist can set.<br />
    The patient&rsquo;s average speed can be calculated by dividing the distance covered by the time taken.<br />

  <p><strong>Section C summary</strong></p>
  <p>Section C was a bit more gentle than in some previous years that threw up nasty and complicated code walkthroughs or stack simulations.</p>
  <p>The formatting of the pseudocode was just plain sloppy. The indentation and bolding of the keywords was all over the shop.</p>
  <p>More room to answer sometimes needs to be provided.</p>
  <p>The examination of new theory (e.g. hash functions) was handled with care and grace.</p>
  <p>The wording of some questions was dubious, for example C5 asking for a data flow <strong>from</strong> an entity that has no such flow provided in the case study. </p>
  <p>C8b was weird. Students are supposed to be experts on mobile phone communication technology? If you want to examine SSL/TLS, <strong>do</strong> that. Don't muddy the water.  </p>
