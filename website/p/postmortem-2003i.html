C&amp;F or B&amp;E. Well, since there are no traditional 
dependency arrows shown, you have to assume that a task that does not 
start on day 1 must be dependent on some other task. So, which tasks are 
dependent on task D (so task D is a predecessor to the tasks)? Remember: 
a predecessor comes before a task that is dependent on it! Which tasks 
start as soon as task D has finished? E and F. So the answer is [A]. Pretty

<p><strong>Adapted from the <a href="http://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/vce/studies/infotech/infoprocess/assessreports/2003/informationprocess03.pdf">2003 Examiners' Report</a></strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li class="examiner">A small proportion of students rewrote the question in the space provided in the question and answer booklet before commencing their response - this is not required and often means that the space in the answer booklet is not used effectively. </li>
<li class="examiner">There were a number of students who were clearly still unfamiliar with the terminology used in the study design. You must be familiar with the definitions in the study design&rsquo;s glossary (page 82&ndash;86) as these are used in setting the examination.</li>
<li class="examiner">Lower scoring students were either unable to explain their answer or did not pick up on the prompts in the questions. For example in Question 10b, there were five areas given to address in their strategy and it was disappointing to see the number of students who did not address all five areas. Lower scores were also given to responses that did not respond in the way indicated by the stem of the question, e.g. listing an answer when an explanation was required. Pay close attention to the type of response required for each question. </li>
<li class="examiner">Higher scoring students were able to explain their answers when required, and relate it to the case study information given in the question. </li>
<li class="examiner">When a question indicates how many reasons or responses are required (e.g. &lsquo;State <strong>two</strong> reasons ...&rsquo;) , you need to provide what is requested. e.g. If you provided more than (for example) <strong>two</strong> reasons, the exam assessors only marked the first <strong>two</strong> reasons provided.</li>

<p class="myanswer">Not too hard. Firstly, A4 printers can't handle

relevant'. Describe what is meant by relevant and provide one example 
of relevant information.</p>
<p class="myanswer">'Relevant' means that the information has value 
to the audience in that it provides the information the audience needs 
or wants. An example of relevant information would be ticket prices on 
a concert poster, a phone number in a newspaper ad, conditions of entry 
in a competition announcement, ingredients on a food product package,

<p class="examiner">Most students were able to explain the <strong>role</strong> of the CD-ROM and give a <strong>limitation </strong>but very few were able to describe a 
<strong>capability</strong>. Many students simply repeated the role of the drive as its capability rather than describing how well it 
performs its function. The expected responses were:<br />
<em>Role</em>: to read files previously stored on CDs; to retrieve or access stored files.<br />
<em>Capability</em>: 48 speed ensures faster retrieval than a floppy disk; Drive accesses data on CD directly, not in sequential order; Drive can access around 600&ndash;700MB of data/information from one CD.<br />
<em>Limitation:</em> cannot write to the disk as it is only a CD-ROM drive so cannot be used to store files created by the user; it can only read certain media (cannot read DVDs).

a web site with a 'Members Only' area.</p>
<p>a. State one method of identifying members that Mr Fedora could use on 
his web site and describe how it would apply.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Mr Fedora would need to password protect the members-only 
directory on the web server, and set up database of authorised user names 
with matching passwords. When a person tries to access any page in the 
password-protected directory, the web server would bring up a login box. 
The person would need to enter a valid user name and password to access 
any of the protected members-only information.</p>

cards lodged with the company. </p>
<p>b. Discuss, in the context of current legislation, one concern you would 
have regarding Mr Fedora's plans.</p>
<p class="myanswer">The National Privacy Principles, embedded in the 
Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) Act 2000, forbid the use of data (such 
as email addresses, purchases etc) for a purpose other than that for which 
the data was collected (e.g. warranty registration). Mr Fedora must not 
use members' private information from the warranty cards on the website 
unless the people have given permission for him to use this information 
for a different purpose.</p>
<p class="examiner">Students were required to discuss ONE concern. To obtain full marks students were required to relate their concern to 
the privacy legislation. Many students only answered half the question, focusing either on the concern and not on how 
this connected to the legislation or focusing on what the legislation states without indicating how Mr Fedora might be 
causing problems.

electronic technique used to validate input data. Illustrate your answer 
with an example of a data item that might be rejected.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Spreadsheet...</p>
<p class="myanswer">In Excel 98 and after, validation rules can be 
used to detect and report invalid data. For example, a cell meant to contain 
a person's age may be told to reject negative numbers or text input.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Another validation technique is to use a formula 
that monitors the contents of another cell and notifies the user if certain 
conditions arise. e.g. If a person's account balance falls below zero, 
a formula in a neighbouring cell could warn that the person is in debt 
e.g. =IF(BALANCE&lt;0, &quot;Person is in debt!&quot;,&quot;&quot;)</p>
<p class="myanswer">Database...</p>
<p class="myanswer">Databases allow validation rules to be attached 
to data fields. Fields can be limited to a range of values (e.g. 0-100), 
or values from a list (e.g. states of Australia). The type of data can 
also be checked (e.g. text, numeric). Values can be forced to be unique 
(e.g. user names), or of certain length (e.g. Australian business numbers, 
credit card numbers.)</p>
<p class="examiner">Students found this question difficult and often listed a validation technique rather than describing it and either did not 
provide an item that would be rejected by the technique or provided an item that would be accepted by the technique. It 
is essential that students read questions carefully to ensure they answer the question that is being asked. Regardless of 
whether the student selected spreadsheet or database, the most common responses by students were to use a range check 
or limit the data type that could be entered into a cell or field.

</p><p>i. A customer is given an extra discount on damaged stock</p>
<p class="myanswer"> OPERATIONAL. </p>
<p class="comment">Some might say &quot;tactical&quot;, 
  I guess, but it's not a big decision. If the store policy were changed 
  to allow this extra discount, that may be be tactical decision in the 
  pursuit of better customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>ii. A company decides to close two of their smaller branches</p>
<p class="myanswer"> TACTICAL. </p>
<p class="comment">Arguably &quot;strategic&quot; if the 
  company had very few branches and closing 2 would be a major cut. If they 
  were multinational, closing 2 small stores would be a &quot;middle manager&quot; 
  strategy to save money. I disagree with the official answer (below) </p>
<p>iii. A receptionist orders a different brand of photocopy paper</p>
<p class="myanswer"> OPERATIONAL. </p>
<p class="comment">No argument about that one.</p>
<hr /> 
<p class="comment">These could be debated. Really, sometimes 
I feel such decisions will depend on the size of the organisation. In 
an owner-operated shop, case (i) might be considered a decision that is 
a bit more than a run-of-the-mill daily choice. In case (ii) if the company 
is a small one with only a few branches, closing 2 branches would be a 
BIG strategic decision for them; for an international industrial juggernaut, 
closing 2 branches would be a minor tactical decision.</p>
<p class="comment">The rule of thumb is that operational decisions 
are those made in the course of day-to-day business. They do not involve 
medium or long-term planning.</p>
<p class="comment">Tactical decisions are those with a medium-length 
timeframe - weeks or months - and usually are aimed at implementing a 
strategic decision.</p>
<p class="comment">The top-level strategic decisions affect the long-term 
direction and purposes of the entire organisation. They are long-term 
- months to years - often expensive, and can greatly influence an organisation's 
successes for the better or worse.</p>

<p>The cartoon above shows a thief attempting to steal data/information 
from a network. </p>
<p class="comment">The question is WHY? The cartoon is completely 
pointless and adds no useful information. What on earth were the examiners 
thinking?</p>
<p>One possible way to prevent this is to install a firewall.</p>
<p>a. Describe how a firewall works</p>
<p class="myanswer">A firewall is a hardware or software device that 
monitors the 65,536 internet ports that are opened when a computer connects 
to the internet. Most of these ports are unused, but others serve as vital 
communication channels (e.g. port 80 is for web pages, 21 is for FTP.) 
Hackers can gain access to a networked computer by sniffing or probing 
for open internet ports and use software to install Trojan Horses or similar 
tools onto a vulnerable system. These tools can later be used to control 
the PC (e.g. participating in a distributed denial of service attack) 
or steal information from it.</p>
<p class="myanswer">The firewall monitors incoming and outgoing activity 
on internet ports and only permits authorised programs to communicate 
with the internet. It also &quot;hides&quot; the unused internet ports 
so any external port probe gets no response : as far as the hacker can 
tell, the PC does not exist. </p>
<p class="examiner">Students knew in general what a firewall was although many of them had difficulty in describing how it worked. </p>
<p>b. Describe one limitation of using a firewall</p>
<p class="myanswer">Well, I can't think of any significant ones.</p>
<ul>
<li class="myanswer">Some software that legitimately needs access 
to the internet may be inadvertently blocked by the firewall. </li>
<li class="myanswer">Running the firewall does consume some of the 
PCs resources and processing time. </li>
<li class="myanswer">Some firewalls do not block unauthorised outgoing 
communications so PCs already infected with a Trojan can still communicate 
with hackers.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Some firewalls cost money to buy.</li>
</ul>
<p class="examiner">Student responses to this question were quite varied and it was often left unanswered. The most common responses, 
however, focused on the:<br />
&bull; need for technical expertise to set up and manage the firewall effectively<br />
&bull; checks slowing down the network<br />
&bull; fact that it can still be bypassed by hackers.</p>
<p>Another strategy that can be used to protect data 
is encryption.</p>
<p>c. Select the email that is most likely to be encrypted 
and justify why it is more likely to be encrypted that either of the other 
two choices.</p>
<p>i. an email message confirming a date and time 
for a meeting.<br />
ii. an email with an attached file asking for bank account details.<br />
iii. an email containing a user's login name and password.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Obviously email (iii) is the one containing the 
most secret and valuable information, and should be encrypted. Email (ii) 
probably will not contain any information that could be used against someone. 
Email (i) is most likely useless to anyone but the recipient, unless the 
very fact that two people were meeting was significant (e.g. an employee 
meeting with the personnel manager of a rival company.)</p>
<p class="examiner">It was expected that students would explain why option <strong>three</strong> was more likely to be encrypted than both option two and 
option one. Teachers should be aware that the examiners expect in the future that if a student is 
given two or more options and asked to justify their choice, <em>students must relate their justification to the options 
provided</em>.</p>
<p class="examiner"> In this question students commonly misread option two as containing personal bank account details rather than 
requesting them.

<td > <p>10. Springfield Lending Library opens Monday to Friday from 9am to 
5pm. The file server stores all the programs for the library - an operating 
system and a library program called 'Borrow All'. Borrow All generates 
a loans data file which records all items out on loan. Currently there 
is no back-up even though a tape back-up unit has been purchased.</p>
<p>a. A computer technician makes the following 3 recommendations about 
possible backup procedures. For each recommendation explain one concern 
you would have if it was implemented.</p>
<p>Recommendation 1 - two tapes to be purchased and rotated</p>
<p>Concern: </p>
<p class="myanswer">Backups would be overwritten too soon - after two 
days, backup information is lost. If data loss were discovered more than 
two days later, the backed up copy would already have been overwritten!</p>
<p class="examiner">Two tapes are not sufficient because:<br />
&bull; if one was damaged then you are always over writing the current backup<br />
&bull; you can only restore/retrieve files from the last two days.</p>
<p>Recommendation 2 - all programs files be backed up daily</p>
<p>Concern:</p>
<p class="myanswer">Backing up program files rather than data is a 
waste of time. If the program files were somehow destroyed, they could 
easily be reinstalled from the original CDs or disks. It's the data that 
are irreplaceable!</p>
<p class="examiner">&bull; program files do not change frequently and so do not need to be backed up daily<br />
&bull; backing up program files daily is a waste of media space or a waste of time as they do not change very often.</p>
<p>Recommendation - backups should be done at 9am</p>
<p>Concern:</p>
<p class="myanswer">Backups should be done when the network is usually 
idle - usually at midnight. One reason is that any files that are open 
and being used cannot be backed up. Another reason is that backups can 
consume considerable resources on a server - and will slow down network 
operations for users.</p>
<p class="examiner">9 am is an inappropriate time to complete a back-up because:<br />
&bull; it is the time the library opens and users will want to login and start up the system and the back-up will make the 
system too slow<br />
&bull; if done at 9 am then none of the previous days changes are saved if something happens overnight.</p>
<p class="examiner">In general, students found this question quite difficult. It was clear that students did not think the recommendations were appropriate, but they found it hard to explain the concern if the recommendation was implemented. </p>
<p>b. Recommend an appropriate backup strategy. Your strategy should 
  cover</p>
<ul>
  <li class="myanswer">content, timing and storage of backup</li>
  <li class="myanswer">media and frequency of backup</li>
  <li class="myanswer">Only data files need be backed up. Program files 
    can be reinstalled from the original CDs.</li>
  <li class="myanswer">Backups should be automated to occur every night 
    when the network is idle.</li>
  <li class="myanswer">Backups should be stored in a secure off-site location.</li>
  <li class="myanswer">Media will be DAT Quarter Inch Cartridges to suit 
    the existing tape drive.</li>
  <li class="myanswer">The best backup protocol would be Grandfather-father-son. 
    This involves a daily tape for each working day of the week. On Monday, 
    a full backup of data is performed, and from Tuesday to the end of the 
    week, incremental backups save only data that has changed since the last 
    full backup. At the end of the week, a full backup is done to one of four 
    weekly tapes. At the end of the month, a full backup is done to one of 
    12 monthly tapes. At the end of the year, a full backup is done to an 
    annual tape that is securely archived and never re-used.</li>
  <li class="myanswer">Since daily tapes are used most frequently (each 
    tape is used once a week), they will wear faster than the other tapes. 
    After a set period of use, daily tapes are 'promoted' to be used as weekly 
    tapes, then after more use they are promoted to become monthly, then annual 
    tapes. Before promotion, tapes must be verified for accuracy and reliability.</li>
</ul>
<p class="examiner">In general, students could recommend appropriate strategies; however, 
  there were weaknesses in many responses. Firstly, students did not address the five areas listed in the question and 
  secondly, their description of a back-up strategy was inappropriate for the organisation described. For example, a small  number of students recommended backing up every time a book was borrowed or returned or every ten to 15 minutes. 
  The expected response was:

  </blockquote>
<p>a. What type of network is described in the above article?</p>
<p class="myanswer">A WAN (Wide Area Network)</p>
<p class="examiner">Students either knew this or tried to reply with a type of network topology (e.g. star). Accepted answers were WAN or 
Wide Area or Wide Area Network.</p>
<p>b. Explain what is meant by 'bandwidth limitations' by referring to the 
article.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Bandwidth is a measure of the amount of data that 
can be transmitted in a given time. Because the Schools of the Air will 
be transmitting video as well as data, they do not have sufficient data-transfer 
capacity to support two-way video data exchange, so students can only 
see the teacher and not vice versa.</p>
<p class="examiner">Students could not describe bandwidth limitations and in general found it difficult to relate to the case study, other than 
quoting the article. At Year 12 it is expected that students will be able to explain in their own words and not just write 
down the exact phrase that appears in the article. The examiners expected students to respond as indicated below.<br />
Bandwidth limitations:<br />
&bull; refers to the amount of bytes that can be transferred in a set amount of time 
OR<br />
&bull; indicates the amount of data that you can send across your connection, the lower the bandwidth the slower the 
response time.<br />
</p>
<p class="examiner">Reference to the article:<br />
&bull; a video image of teachers and students would take a lot of bytes to look real and so if there is a restriction on the 
bandwidth then fewer images will be used, e.g. teachers only initially.<br />
An example was accepted if it related to the distance education scenario, even though it was not directly mentioned in 
the article.</p>
<p>c. In the future 'on an outback station, a student communicates in real-time 
with the teacher and other students via a web cam attached to the PC. 
Email replaces the slow and unreliable postal service.'</p>
<p>Discuss two benefits of upgrading to a real-time system with email facilities 
for students.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Teachers will be able to conduct classes involving 
visual aspects rather than only tasks that can be done by speech (e.g. 
art, drama). The teacher will be able to immediately see a student's performance 
and offer immediate feedback. The important human connection needed in 
teaching will be reinforced by students and teachers being able able to 
see each other's body language and facial expressions.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Email will allow the instant sharing of documents 
with teachers and other students. The documents could contain text, pictures, 
even music and multimedia work. The teacher will be able to assess students 
far more quickly, and will be easily able to edit student work and return 
it immediately.</p>
<p class="examiner">Benefits were required to relate to either real-time or email and most students picked up on this requirement. Lower order responses tended to list the benefit rather 
than discuss it. The most common responses related to the following benefits.<br />
&bull; instant response/feedback for students rather than waiting. The new system will allow teachers to receive work 
within minutes rather than days and to return work equally as quickly<br />
&bull; the teacher can demonstrate visually which is clearer than just words and go over difficult areas immediately. The 
interaction, possible in real-time, improves the learning experience for students<br />
&bull; more variety of tasks makes education more interesting; students are able to submit a wider variety of work via 
email, e.g. sound, video, multimedia to the teacher without risking it being damaged in the mail<br />
&bull; immediate response to difficulties; teachers can answer student queries on the spot as they arise rather than waiting 
for a letter and show them visually how to solve the problem.</p>
<p>Once the network with the web cam has been fully implemented, students 
will be surveyed about the success of the change.</p>
<p>d. Prepare 2 questions for inclusion in the survey. The first question 
must focus on identifying any improvements in the efficiency of the network. 
The second question must focus on the effectiveness of the new network.</p>
<p>Efficiency</p>
<ul>

more quickly than with the old system?</li>
<li class="myanswer">Has taking classes become any easier for you?</li>
<li class="myanswer">Have you been able to complete work more quickly 
with the new system?</li>
</ul>
<p class="examiner">The proposed questions in the survey needed to be specific and not general, e.g. 'Is it more efficient?' Students found it 
difficult to frame a question and often reversed the efficiency and effectiveness responses.<br />
This question must relate to efficiency (time/cost/effort)<br />
&bull; is it easier to send your assignments to your teacher?<br />
&bull; does it take less effort to send your work to your teacher?<br />
&bull; has the new system helped you to meet due dates for assignments?</p>
<p>Effectiveness</p>
<ul>
<li class="myanswer">Do you think you have you been learning more 
with the new system or the old system?</li>
<li class="myanswer">Have your grades improved under the new system?</li>
<li class="myanswer">Do you feel happier and more connected with

overseas clients, which was clearly not part of the scenario. The most common reasons were:<br />

&bull; easy to change or update and cheaper to redesign a website than redo a brochure<br />
&bull; communication, e.g. ordering can be done easily via an online form<br />

&bull; target audience is generally younger and more computer literate<br />
&bull; a website could allow the user to design their own floral display<br />
&bull; a website is more timely and can have more up to date information than a printed brochure<br />
&bull; the one website can deal with all three locations at once.</p>
<hr /> 
<p>b. Outline one reason why the manager would request a screen layout 
mockup as a design representation before approving the website.</p>
<p class="myanswer">The appearance of a website has a big impact on its success. Ugly or 
hard-to-read screens will deter or confuse visitors. The manager would 
want to see that:</p>
<ul>
<li class="myanswer"> navigation controls were easy to find and unambiguous 
in their behaviour</li>
<li class="myanswer">colours were attractive, did not make text unreadable, 
and were visible to colour-blind men</li>
<li class="myanswer">font selections were appropriate and attractive</li>
<li class="myanswer">page elements appeared in appropriate and optimal 
places (e.g. banners, links)</li>
<li class="myanswer">no important page elements were missing (e.g. 
contact info, date of last page revision, links to online ordering)</li>
<li class="myanswer">frames, if used, are sensibly organised and 
helpful rather than a hindrance</li>
<li class="myanswer">tables are used to constrain and position pictures 
and text</li>
<li class="myanswer">page sizes are suitable for the most common 
screen resolutions</li>
</ul>
<p class="examiner">Students generally handled this well, although it was clear that a small number of students did not know what a screen 
layout mock-up represented. Accepted reasons included:<br />
&bull; being able to see what the final page/site will look like for approval<br />
&bull; ensuring that the company image presented is what the company requires.</p>
<p>The solution attribute of functionality needs to be tested.</p>
<p>c. State two tests that would test the solution's functionality and explain 
how you would conduct each test.</p>
<p>Test 1</p>
<p class="myanswer">Testing that links to other pages or sites work</p>
<p>Explanation</p>
<p class="myanswer">Click each link on each page and see whether the 
appropriate destination is reached.</p>
<p>Test 2</p>
<p class="myanswer">Testing that images, animations and alternative 
text appear as expected</p>
<p>Explanation</p>
<p class="myanswer">View the page using different versions of different 
browsers (e.g. Netscape 4,6, IE 4,5,6, Opera, Safari on a Mac, Netscape 
running on Linux), different screen resolutions (e.g. 640x480, 800x600, 
1024 x 976) to check that images appear properly, alt text is correct, 
animations play with each browser type and version. If problems arise 
with a particular plugin, browser type or version of browser, an attempt 
should be made to provide the same information in an alternative manner 
(e.g. graphics links need text equivalents, framed sites need a 'frameless' 
version). Javascript should be thoroughly tested for correct results, 
and consideration given to users who lack JS - no essential page functions 
should be available only through JS, Java or exotic plugins (e.g. Flash) 
- some 'plain vanilla' alternative method should be offered (e.g. you 
should not support feedback or contact only through forms - provide an 
email address that people can use if their browser does not handle forms 
properly.)</p>
<p class="examiner">Students found it difficult to identify a test that related to functionality and the term was clearly unfamiliar to a large 
number. Students commonly responded with surveys, which showed customer satisfaction rather than testing 
functionality. Those students who were able to identify a test that related to functionality of the solution still had 
difficulty explaining how the test would be conducted.</p>

<p>d. Identify a sample group of people who could be used to test the 
  solution. Justify your choice.</p>
<p>Sample group</p>
<p class="myanswer">Volunteer customers may be invited to test the 
site.</p>
<p>Justification</p>
<p class="myanswer">Solutions should be tested by typical members of 
the target audience. By selecting existing customers, you should get a 
reasonable cross-section of the total population of potential users. It 
is important to use typical people rather than IT specialists - specialists 
are not likely to suffer the same sorts of mistakes, confusion and misunderstandings 
that a typical site visitor would suffer. </p>
<p class="examiner">In general, students selected an appropriate sample group but the lower responses showed little evidence of being able 
to justify the choice made.</p>
<p>e. Two possible criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the 
  web site would be</p>
<p>i. number of hits</p>
<p>ii. number of online orders placed by email has increased</p>
<p>Select the criterion you would recommend and justify your choice.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Criterion ii actually measures sales, and hence 
profit, which is the primary organisational goal. Large numbers of visitors 
who don't buy anything is a waste of time, effort and money for the organisation.</p>
<p class="examiner">It was noticeable that students had difficulty justifying their choice. The expected response was option two. Accepted justifications included:<br />
&bull; this evaluates effectiveness better because the number of hits does not necessarily reflect in sales. People may have 
searched for a related word and the search engine brings up this site as a hit and an user checks it out<br />
&bull; the number of orders is a better criterion than the number of hits because the business has made a sale, therefore 
showing an improvement in performance.</p>

<td > <p>13. Cheapway Supermarkets is planning to introduce a self-scanning system 
into its supermarkets. Instead of checkout attendants, customers will 
take their items to a self-scanning terminal. Customers will scan each 
item and press a button. After all items have been scanned the terminal 
will print a docket, which will be taken to the cashier for payment. There 
will be one cashier for every four terminals.</p>
<p>a. Identify and explain one health and safety requirement that will need 
to be considered when customers use this new system.</p>
<p>Health and safety requirement</p>
<p class="comment">Hmmm - this is a dicey one. There's not a lot of 
interest or importance to say...</p>
<ul>
<li class="blue">Customers should not suffer lifting injuries 
by having to man-handle large or heavy items</li>
<li class="blue">Customers should not be able to blind themselves 
with the laser from the scanning gun (?)</li>
<li class="blue">The system should be electrically safe and not 
electrocute customers (??)</li>
<li class="blue">The system should not emit dangerous radiation 
(???)</li>
<li class="blue">The system should not explode, or release toxic 
gases :-)</li>
</ul>
<p class="examiner">Students who could identify a concern were usually able to explain why this was. A number listed concerns that had no 
relevance to the case study or the tasks being undertaken by the customers, and a small number provided no response to 
this question.</p>
<p class="comment">This was because it was a BAD QUESTION! Don't blame students for being unable to answer a question that has no clear answer. </p>
<p>Explanation</p>
<p class="myanswer">You don't want customers crippled, blinded, electrocuted, 
irradiated or blown to bits?</p>

<p>The first set of four terminals will be installed in the city store 
  three months before installation in other stores.</p>
<p>b. Identify the changeover method.</p>
<p class="comment">Note: implementation methods are no longer part of the study design. (2011-2014)</p>
<p class="myanswer">Pilot.</p>
<p>Management thinks that self-scanning terminals will reduce company costs.</p>
<p>c. Using one example, discuss why this may not occur.</p>
<ul>
<li class="myanswer">The costs of buying, installing, maintaining 
and upgrading the system might outweigh the costs of the current system.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Customers might not like the new system and 
might go elsewhere to do their shopping.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Extra staff might need to be put on to help 
customers who are having trouble with the system, negating the cost-saving 
achieved by downsizing the checkout-chick workforce. Also, extra staff 
may need to be retained to monitor customers who &quot;cheat&quot; during 
scanning.</li>
<li class="myanswer">Extra training for staff using the new system 
would incur costs</li>
<li class="myanswer">Advertising and public education to increase 
customer acceptance would be expensive</li>
</ul>
<p class="examiner">In general, students handled this question appropriately and indicated why costs might not be reduced. However, the 
common error was to focus on reduced income from loss of customers rather than look at company costs as indicated in 
the question. Some of the more common responses were:<br />
&bull; customers scanning their own items should reduce the tasks undertaken by cashiers. However, if there is a problem 
with scanning an item, a staff member will be needed to fix the problem, so staff work will change rather than 
reduce<br />
&bull; customers may not scan all the items that are in their trolley leading to an increasing problem of theft (shop lifting).<br />
&bull; this will increase the costs of running the store<br />
&bull; allowing all customers to use the equipment may cause more breakdowns and mean that repair<br />
bills/maintenance/replacement costs are higher than if trained staff used the terminals<br />
&bull; it will be slower as customers are less experienced than trained staff in using the scanner and so the cashier will be 
standing around idle for periods of time<br />
&bull; more staff will be needed initially to train customers and they will be needed the whole time that the store is in 
operation even if there are very few customers using the store (e.g. late at night if it&rsquo;s open extended hours).</p>
<hr /> 
<p>The diagram below represents some of the tasks 
to be completed to install the terminals in the city store.</p>
<p class="comment">Note: PERT and Gantt are no longer part of the study design (2011-2014)</p>
<p><img src= "/m/pm/03i-qb15.gif" width="641" height="291" /></p>
<p>d. i. Mark the critical path</p>
<blockquote>&nbsp;</blockquote>
<p><img src= "/m/pm/03i-qb15-cp.gif" width="641" height="291" /></p>
<p class="examiner">This question was poorly done and students frequently omitted to mark the critical path or marked the whole diagram. 
Students either knew the term and its meaning or were clearly guessing.</p>
<p><b>OTHER POINTS OF VIEW - from Antony</b></p>
<p> <em>We see the critical path as 5 days only as 
part d (ii) tells us that the project finished before the opening celebrations 
began. Note that this little gem of information is given to students after they 
have just used their thick black texta.</em></p>
<p><em>It's an iffy one. My philosophy is that if it's 
in the PERT, it must be part of the project. If not, why is it there? 
PERTs describe projects :-)</em></p>
<p><em>I'd be upset if examiners expected kids to ignore 
the end of the PERT!</em></p>
<p>ii. Explain why the supermarket has allowed a week between the completion 
  of the project and the opening celebrations.</p>
<p class="myanswer">'Bedding-down' time? Allows the staff to become 
familiar and comfortable with the new system. <br />
Also gives time for unexpected 'bugs' to appear and be dealt with. <br />
Allows time for advertising the celebrations.</p>
<p class="examiner">Most students could explain contingency planning and the only common error was to indicate that one of the tasks in the original diagram was going to occur during the week (e.g. training of the cashier). The two most common responses were:<br />
One week has been allowed for:<br />
&bull; fixing any problems that occur during the testing of the system<br />
&bull; allowing for any delays that might occur so that the store meets its opening date.</p>
<p>e. List two groups of people who will need to be trained to use the new 
system and explain the type of training you would recommend for each group.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Managers - need to gain an overview of the whole 
system so they understand its operation and the roles of people who use 
it. Small-group training would be suitable.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Customers - need to know how to carry out scanning 
and make payment, how to cope with common problems (e.g. items that won't 
scan). Public advertising can demonstrate how to use the new system. One-on-one 
training of customers by staff could be used for customers who have trouble 
with the system.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Cashiers / Staff - need to know how to fix common 
problems (e.g. items that won't scan, dirty scanners, incompetent customers), 
need to be able to spot customers who are 'cheating' by deliberately not 
scanning all items. For the pilot installation, small-group training would 
be best. For full roll-out to all stores, a train-the-trainer program 
might be most effective and efficient.</p>
<p class="myanswer">Technicians - may need to be trained in the workings 
of the new equipment so they can repair or upgrade it when necessary. 
Since there are few technicians, small-group training supported by comprehensive 
documentation would be best.</p>
<p class="myanswer">All training would be carried out on-site, preferably 
outside normal working hours (with some form of compensation given to 
staff for giving up their personal time).</p>
<p class="examiner">In this question the better students had the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge and the question produced an 
effective spread of marks. Weaker students were able to identify appropriate groups but in general were unable to come 
up with appropriate types of training. Better responses provided detailed strategies for each user group. Many students 
only indicated some of the content of the training, rather than giving a detailed response. The most common responses 
were:</p>
