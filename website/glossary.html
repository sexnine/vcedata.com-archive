        <p>You are unlikely to be asked to <strong>define</strong> a term in an exam (but it <em>is</em> possible). More likely, these terms will be used in questions and you will be expected to interpret and respond to them correctly.</p>
        <p>If your personal definition of a term does not agree with VCAA's,  suck it down and don't argue. You won't win. Use VCAA's definition. </p>
        <p>For years I waged a campaign to have 'ease of use' removed from the definition of 'efficiency'. Eventually, I won, but in the meantime I had to suck it down and answer questions using VCAA's wonky definition.</p>
